# How to Perform a Competitive Analysis Informed by Real User Insights

A few years ago, I worked on a project to redesign a food delivery app. We thought the competition was obvious — faster delivery, better menus, more discounts. But after interviewing drivers and customers, we discovered something surprising: people didn’t just want speed. They wanted *predictability*. They wanted to know *when* their food would actually arrive, even if it took a bit longer. That insight changed everything about how we approached our **competitive analysis**.

Competitive analysis isn’t just about comparing feature checklists or colors on screens — it’s about understanding what *really matters* to users and seeing how well competitors deliver on those expectations.

## What Is Competitive Analysis?

A **competitive analysis** helps you understand how other products in your space solve similar problems. It identifies what’s working, what’s missing, and where your product could stand out.  

But here’s the twist — your analysis becomes far more meaningful when it’s **informed by user research**. Insights from interviews and observations help you focus on what users actually care about, not just what looks trendy or advanced.

> Think of it as listening to users first, then looking at competitors through their eyes.

## Step 1: Gather Your User Insights

Before you compare anyone else, ground yourself in what you’ve already learned.  
Review your interview notes, observations, or field studies. Look for patterns like:
- Pain points (“It’s too hard to find what I need.”)
- Wish lists (“I wish it remembered my preferences.”)
- Workarounds (“I keep a spreadsheet because the app doesn’t let me export data.”)

These are your **lenses** for analysis — they guide what to look for in other products.

**Example:**  
If you observed that users struggle to find previous orders in your app, focus your competitor review on how others handle order history, filters, and search.

## Step 2: Identify Key Competitors

Choose 3–5 competitors to analyze. They might include:
- **Direct competitors**: Products that do the same thing for the same audience.  
- **Indirect competitors**: Products that solve the same problem in a different way.  
- **Aspirational competitors**: Companies outside your industry known for great UX or innovation.

For instance, if you’re building a fitness tracking app, your direct competitors might be Strava or Fitbit, but you could also look at Duolingo for how it motivates users with progress feedback.

## Step 3: Create a Feature Comparison Matrix

List the core features that matter most to users — the ones revealed in your interviews and observations.  

| Feature / Competitor | App A | App B | App C | Notes |
|-----------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| Personalized dashboard | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | App C lacks customization |
| Progress tracking | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | All offer tracking, but App B’s visuals are most intuitive |
| Goal reminders | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | App A misses this key motivation feature |
| Offline mode | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | Users in rural areas prefer A and C |

You’ll notice that this approach turns your matrix into a **user-centered scorecard**, not just a list of “cool features.”

## Step 4: Evaluate User Experience and Emotional Tone

Numbers and checkmarks tell part of the story — but **how it feels** to use a product matters just as much.  

As you test competitors:
- Pay attention to **flow** — how many steps does it take to complete a task?  
- Note **clarity** — are labels intuitive or confusing?  
- Observe **emotion** — does the app feel encouraging, overwhelming, or indifferent?

**Example:**  
When comparing two budgeting tools, one team found both offered the same core features. But in interviews, users said they preferred the app that *celebrated small wins* with positive feedback — not the one that scolded them for overspending. The difference wasn’t functionality; it was empathy.

---

## Step 5: Identify Gaps and Opportunities

Now, connect the dots between your user insights and what the competitors offer. Ask:
- What are competitors doing *well* that your users would love?  
- What user needs are still *unmet* across all products?  
- What *pain points* could you address more elegantly?  

This is where innovation lives — in the space between what users want and what competitors currently provide.

**Example:**  
In the food delivery project, no app we analyzed gave real-time driver updates with reliable ETAs. Based on customer interviews about “predictability,” we made that our key differentiator — and users loved it.

---

## Step 6: Tell the Story

Summarize your findings in a way that’s easy for your team to act on:
- A short **presentation or report** with visuals (screenshots, charts, quotes)
- A **“feature gap heatmap”** highlighting where competitors excel or fall short
- A list of **strategic recommendations** directly tied to user insights

Keep it simple, visual, and grounded in the real voices of your users.

---

## Why It Works

When you combine **user research** with **competitive analysis**, you stop designing in a vacuum. You’re not copying features — you’re learning from the market and filling the gaps that matter most.  

It’s a shift from *“What do they have that we don’t?”* to *“What do our users need that no one’s giving them yet?”*

---

**Bottom Line:**  
Competitive analysis isn’t about winning a feature race. It’s about understanding the landscape through your users’ eyes — where they struggle, what delights them, and where your product can stand apart. When you tie your analysis back to real interviews and observations, you build not just a smarter product, but one that genuinely serves the people who use it.
