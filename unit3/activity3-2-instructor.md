# Instructor Guide: Step 2 — Brainstorming and Affinity Mapping

## Overview
This session follows the **Mock Workshop Simulation (Step 1)**.  
Students will practice generating, clustering, and labeling requirements using **brainstorming** and **affinity mapping** techniques introduced in their readings:
- *Using Brainstorming and Affinity Mapping to Cluster Requirement Themes*  
- *Developing Facilitation and Consensus-Building Skills*  

By the end of the class, each group will produce and **submit an affinity map and short explanation** rather than presenting it in class.

---

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this class, students will be able to:
- Generate and organize raw ideas into requirement themes using brainstorming and affinity mapping.  
- Collaborate and negotiate meaning within small groups to identify shared understanding.  
- Apply facilitation and consensus-building skills in a structured discussion.  
- Create a clear visual deliverable demonstrating grouped requirements.

## Class Duration: 60 minutes
| Segment | Time | Purpose |
|----------|------|----------|
| Introduction & Setup | 5 min | Review concepts and expectations |
| Brainstorming | 15 min | Capture all ideas from the workshop |
| Affinity Mapping | 30 min | Organize and label ideas into clusters |
| Reflection & Submission | 10 min | Finalize and turn in deliverable |

---

## Preparation Before Class
- Review outcomes from Step 1 (Mock Workshop Simulation) to remind students of context.  
- Prepare a demonstration workspace (Jamboard, Miro, or whiteboard) with a few sample notes to illustrate clustering.  
- Ensure Canvas assignment for this activity is published and ready for submission.

---

## Materials Needed
- Sticky notes or virtual boards (Miro, Jamboard, Mural, Google Slides)  
- Markers or pens (for physical classes)  
- Timer or visible clock  
- Sample affinity map slide or image  

---

## Facilitation Plan

### **1. Introduction & Setup (5 minutes)**
**Purpose:** Frame the activity and reinforce reading concepts.  
**Instructor Notes:**
- Remind students that this step transforms workshop ideas into structured insights.
- Reiterate: “Brainstorming collects everything; affinity mapping organizes it into meaning.”
- Show an example of 5–6 notes grouped into two clusters to demonstrate the process.  
- Clarify deliverables: screenshot of their map + short written summary (3–5 sentences).

---

### **2. Brainstorming Session (15 minutes)**
**Student Task:** Capture every idea from their workshop without filtering.  

**Instructor Notes:**
- Encourage speed and inclusivity—every voice counts.  
- Walk around to observe interactions. Reinforce active listening.  
- If students stall, ask:  
  > “What other needs or pain points came up in your discussion?”  

---

### **3. Affinity Mapping (30 minutes)**
**Student Task:** Group similar ideas and label clusters with meaningful themes.

**Instructor Notes:**
- Encourage groups to think about *relationships* and *patterns*, not just categories.  
- Model or project one example of labeling (e.g., “User Experience,” “Security & Access”).  
- Remind them that disagreement is normal; consensus should focus on understanding, not perfection.  
- Ensure each group takes a screenshot or photo when finished.  

---

### **4. Reflection & Submission (10 minutes)**
**Student Task:** Write a short explanation (3–5 sentences) describing their clusters and reasoning.  

**Instructor Notes:**
- Remind students to upload both their **affinity map image** and **short written explanation** to Canvas before the end of class.  
- Circulate to answer questions or check for completion.  

**Prompt if needed:**  
> “What story do your clusters tell about what users and the organization value most?”  

---

## Debrief (Optional if time allows)
If time remains, briefly ask:
- What patterns appeared across different groups?  
- Which facilitation techniques helped most in reaching consensus?  
- What might you change before writing your BRD?

---

## Deliverables to Collect
- One **Affinity Map** per group (photo or digital screenshot).  
- One **written explanation (3–5 sentences)** submitted with the map.  

---

## Connection to the Larger Unit
This step transforms **raw elicitation data** into structured insights.  
The submitted affinity maps will serve as the **foundation for Step 3: Business Requirements Document (BRD) Drafting**, where students formalize their findings into high-level needs aligned with IEEE standards.
