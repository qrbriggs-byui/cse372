# Suggested Learning Activities for Requirements Workshop and BRD Module

## 1. Facilitate or participate in a requirements workshop to gather group perspectives
**Goal:** Help students experience how facilitation and collaboration shape requirements gathering.  

**Activities:**
- **Mock Workshop Simulation:**  
  Divide students into stakeholder groups (e.g., users, business owners, developers). Assign each group a project scenario (such as “new student scheduling app”). Have one or two students act as facilitators while others play stakeholder roles.  
  → *Students practice leading discussions, setting ground rules, and summarizing needs.*

- **Facilitator Reflection Journal:**  
  After the simulation, have facilitators write a short reflection on what went well, where communication broke down, and how they handled differing opinions.  
  → *Reinforces active listening, empathy, and neutral facilitation.*

## 2. Use brainstorming and affinity mapping to cluster requirement themes
**Goal:** Teach students to move from raw ideas to organized, actionable insights.  

**Activities:**
- **Brainstorming Session:**  
  After the workshop, students use sticky notes or a virtual board (like Miro or Jamboard) to capture every idea that emerged—no filtering.  
  → *Encourages open ideation and creative thinking.*

- **Affinity Mapping Exercise:**  
  Students work in small teams to group similar ideas into clusters (e.g., “Usability,” “Automation,” “Data Management”). Then label each cluster with a theme.  
  → *Reveals patterns and helps students practice categorizing qualitative data.*

- **Mini-Presentation:**  
  Each team shares their clusters and explains how they determined the categories.  
  → *Builds communication and justification skills.*

## 3. Document high-level needs in a **Business Requirements Document (BRD)**
**Goal:** Transform qualitative insights into a structured professional document.  

**Activities:**
- **BRD Drafting Workshop:**  
  Using their clustered themes, each team writes a short BRD that includes:  
  - Introduction and purpose  
  - Business objectives  
  - High-level requirements  
  - Scope (in and out)  
  - Stakeholders  
  - Success criteria  
  → *Students practice applying templates and writing clear, outcome-focused requirements.*

- **Peer Review Exchange:**  
  Groups swap BRDs and provide feedback using a checklist (clarity, alignment with goals, completeness).  
  → *Teaches students to critique constructively and recognize quality documentation.*

## 4. Connect workshop results to organizational goals and constraints
**Goal:** Encourage strategic thinking by linking technical ideas to real-world business priorities.  

**Activities:**
- **Goal-Constraint Mapping Activity:**  
  Provide each team with a set of organizational goals and sample constraints (e.g., limited budget, legacy system, short timeline).  
  Ask them to map each major requirement in their BRD to at least one goal and identify any constraint that affects it.  
  → *Develops systems thinking and business alignment skills.*

- **Alignment Presentation / Discussion:**  
  Have teams present how their proposed features support the organization’s goals.  
  → *Promotes critical thinking, justification, and alignment awareness.*

- **Instructor-Led Debrief:**  
  Discuss how prioritization changes when goals or constraints shift (e.g., what happens if funding is reduced or a deadline is accelerated?).  
  → *Builds adaptability and understanding of trade-offs in real-world projects.*

## Optional Integration
To link all four activities:
1. **Workshop & Brainstorming** → Generate diverse ideas.  
2. **Affinity Mapping** → Organize and prioritize themes.  
3. **BRD Drafting** → Formalize findings into professional documentation.  
4. **Goal-Constraint Mapping** → Evaluate strategic fit and practical limitations.  

Each activity builds logically on the previous one, mirroring the progression from **elicitation → analysis → documentation → validation** that students will encounter in industry practice.
