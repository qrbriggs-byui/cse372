### **Week 1: Introduction to Requirements Elicitation and Documentation**

* Define requirements and their importance in the SDLC.

* Differentiate between business, user, functional, and non-functional requirements.

* Explore the six major course outcomes and how they map to industry practice.

* Introduce IEEE standards and common documentation types (BRD, SRS, user stories, use cases, acceptance criteria).

* Practice foundational professional skills: communication, teamwork, and active listening.

---

### **Weeks 2–3: Interviews & Observations → Use Cases & Competitive Analysis**

* Practice structured and unstructured stakeholder interviews.

* Conduct observations or job shadowing to capture workflows and tacit requirements.

* Translate elicitation data into **use cases** that describe user interactions.

* Perform a **competitive analysis** to identify features and gaps informed by interview/observation insights.

* Apply active listening and note-taking skills to capture accurate requirements.

---

### **Weeks 4–5: Workshops & Brainstorming → Business Requirements Document (BRD)**

* Facilitate or participate in a requirements workshop to gather group perspectives.

* Use brainstorming and affinity mapping to cluster requirement themes.

* Document high-level needs in a **Business Requirements Document (BRD)**.

* Connect workshop results to organizational goals and constraints.

* Develop facilitation and consensus-building skills.

---

### **Weeks 6–7: Surveys & Prototypes → User Stories & Acceptance Criteria**

* Design and deploy user surveys to gather large-scale feedback.

* Build low-fidelity prototypes (wireframes, clickable mockups) to elicit clarifications.

* Transform findings into **user stories** with **acceptance criteria**.

* Explore formats for acceptance criteria (checklist, Given-When-Then).

* Practice communicating requirements visually and textually to diverse stakeholders.

---

### **Weeks 8–9: Agile Ceremonies (Backlog Grooming & Sprint Planning) → Agile Artifacts**

* Participate in backlog grooming to refine and prioritize user stories.

* Use sprint planning to uncover hidden dependencies and refine acceptance criteria.

* Document requirements in agile-friendly forms (refined **user stories**, **epics**, and acceptance tests).

* Apply prioritization techniques (MoSCoW, WSJF).

* Practice collaborative negotiation and prioritization with stakeholders.

---

### **Weeks 10–11: Standards-Based Gap Analysis → Software Requirements Specification (SRS) **

* Apply IEEE standards (29148, 830\) to analyze requirements for completeness and consistency.

* Identify gaps, redundancies, or ambiguities in prior elicitation outputs.

* Refine and consolidate requirements into a formal **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)**.

* Emphasize measurability, traceability, and testability.

* Practice technical writing and critical analysis of requirements quality.

---

### **Weeks 12–13: AI-Assisted Requirements Elicitation**

* Introduce the evolution of AI in requirements engineering and its application to elicitation and analysis.

* Explore AI tools such as large language models and repositories like **Speckit** for knowledge-driven elicitation.

* Use AI systems to identify ambiguity, duplication, and conflicts in requirement statements.

* Apply prompt-engineering techniques to refine elicitation outputs and tailor AI assistance to project contexts.

* Develop critical evaluation and ethical judgment skills for responsible use of AI in engineering practice.

---

### **Week 14: Final Exam & Course Reflection**

* Complete a comprehensive final exam covering elicitation techniques, analysis, documentation standards, and verification methods.

* Demonstrate mastery of requirements elicitation, modeling, and documentation.

* Reflect on readiness to apply these skills in professional practice.
