# Instructor Guide: Workshop 2 – Sprint Planning, Dependencies, and Acceptance Criteria  
**Application Context:** MealMaster – A meal planning and grocery list app  
**Duration:** 45 minutes  
**Focus:** Helping students identify dependencies, define acceptance criteria, and practice collaborative negotiation  
**Power Skill:** Collaborative negotiation and prioritization with stakeholders  

---

## 1. Workshop Overview
This workshop builds on Workshop 1’s backlog grooming exercise.  
Students now simulate a **Sprint Planning** session—deciding which stories to include, uncovering hidden **dependencies**, and refining **acceptance criteria** for clarity and alignment.  

The session also reinforces **collaborative negotiation** as a critical Agile power skill.

---

## 2. Learning Outcomes
By the end of this session, students should be able to:
- Explain Sprint Planning’s role in Agile.  
- Identify dependencies that may impact delivery.  
- Write clear, testable acceptance criteria.  
- Demonstrate negotiation and emotional intelligence in group decision-making.

## 3. Key Concepts to Review (5 minutes)
| Term | Definition |
|------|-------------|
| **Sprint Planning** | The meeting where the team decides which user stories to include in the sprint. |
| **Sprint Backlog** | The set of user stories the team commits to completing in the sprint. |
| **Dependency** | A relationship where one story or task relies on another being completed first. |
| **Acceptance Criteria** | Testable conditions that define when a story is considered done. |
| **Collaborative Negotiation** | Working together to reach a shared solution rather than competing for individual preferences. |

## 4. 45-Minute Agenda

| Time | Activity | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| 0:00–0:05 | **Introduction** | Briefly review Workshop 1 results and introduce Sprint Planning goals. Define key terms. |
| 0:05–0:15 | **Select Sprint Stories** | Teams choose 3–4 top-priority stories. Prompt them to justify their choices and discuss feasibility. |
| 0:15–0:25 | **Identify Dependencies** | Teams create a list or simple diagram showing dependencies. Encourage questions like “What could block this story?” |
| 0:25–0:40 | **Define Acceptance Criteria & Negotiate Scope** | Guide students to write Given/When/Then statements. Ask them to negotiate adjustments for scope or complexity. |
| 0:40–0:45 | **Reflection & Wrap-Up** | Quick group share: one negotiation takeaway or surprising dependency. Preview next workshop (Agile documentation). |

## 5. Instructor Facilitation Tips

### a. Reinforce Team Collaboration
Remind students that Sprint Planning is about *commitment as a team*, not assigning tasks individually.  
Encourage open discussion about trade-offs between scope and value.

### b. Model the Product Owner Role
Periodically challenge teams by playing a stakeholder:
- “What if we need a demo-ready feature for next week?”  
- “Could this story wait until a later sprint?”  
These prompts force negotiation and critical thinking.

### c. Coach on Acceptance Criteria Quality
Push students to write specific, testable statements:
- Avoid vague language like “It should work well.”  
- Use clear outcomes like “The app displays a confirmation message.”

### d. Observe Emotional Intelligence in Action
Note how teams handle disagreements. Highlight effective listening, empathy, and compromise.  
Share positive examples during the debrief.

## 6. Deliverables and Evaluation
Each team should submit:
1. **Sprint Backlog Summary (3–4 stories)**  
2. **Dependency List or Map**  
3. **Acceptance Criteria (2–3 per story)**  
4. **Short Reflection (3–4 sentences)**  

**Optional Scoring Rubric (out of 10 points):**
| Category | Points | Criteria |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| Sprint Backlog | 3 | Achievable, clear rationale |
| Dependencies | 2 | Logical and realistic |
| Acceptance Criteria | 3 | Testable and clearly written |
| Reflection | 2 | Insightful, shows teamwork and negotiation awareness |

## 7. Debrief Discussion Prompts
Use these to guide the wrap-up or next class discussion:
- Which dependencies caught your team by surprise?  
- How did negotiation help align technical and business priorities?  
- What was the most useful part of writing acceptance criteria?  
- How can identifying dependencies early improve team efficiency?

---

## 8. Key Teaching Points
- Sprint Planning is about **shared ownership**, not just scheduling.  
- Hidden dependencies can derail sprints if not identified early.  
- Acceptance criteria clarify expectations and improve quality.  
- Negotiation and empathy turn differences into collaborative solutions.  
- This activity prepares students for **Workshop 3**—documenting requirements in Agile-friendly forms.
