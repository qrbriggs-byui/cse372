# Using Sprint Planning to Uncover Hidden Dependencies and Refine Acceptance Criteria

When a new sprint begins, one of the most important meetings your Agile team will hold is **Sprint Planning**. This is where ideas from the product backlog turn into a concrete plan for the next development cycle. It’s a moment of alignment—where engineers, product owners, and designers agree on what will be built, how it will be done, and what “done” actually means.

But Sprint Planning isn’t just about scheduling work. It’s also a powerful time to uncover **hidden dependencies**—tasks, systems, or people your work relies on—and to clarify **acceptance criteria**, which define how you’ll know a story is complete. Let’s explore how this process works and why it’s so valuable to a software team.

## 1. A Quick Overview of Scrum and Sprint Planning

**Scrum** is one of the most common frameworks in Agile software development. It organizes work into short, time-boxed periods called **sprints**, usually lasting two to four weeks. Each sprint produces a working piece of software that could, in theory, be released to users.

At the start of each sprint, the team holds a **Sprint Planning meeting**—typically led by the **Scrum Master** and **Product Owner**. The purpose of this meeting is to:

1. Decide which user stories (from the backlog) will be included in the sprint  
2. Break those stories into smaller tasks  
3. Clarify what success looks like for each story  

The result is a **Sprint Backlog**, a clear and agreed-upon list of work the team commits to completing in the sprint.

## 2. What Are Dependencies (and Why They Matter)?

A **dependency** is anything your work depends on to move forward. This could be another team’s deliverable, a third-party API, a design mock-up, or even approval from a stakeholder. Dependencies are part of every project, but if they’re not discovered early, they can cause unexpected delays later.

**Hidden dependencies** are the tricky ones—those you don’t realize exist until mid-sprint, when suddenly you can’t finish your task because you’re waiting on someone else.

For example, imagine your team is building a new “user profile” feature. You plan to store profile pictures in the cloud, but during Sprint Planning, a developer points out that the cloud storage service isn’t set up yet—and another team is responsible for it. That’s a hidden dependency. Catching it early means you can adjust plans, coordinate with the other team, or choose a temporary workaround.

The beauty of Sprint Planning is that it gathers everyone’s perspectives, making it easier to spot these dependencies before they become blockers.

## 3. What Are Acceptance Criteria?

**Acceptance criteria** are the conditions that must be met for a user story to be considered complete and acceptable to the customer or product owner. They define what “done” means in practical, testable terms.

For example, if your user story is:

> “As a shopper, I want to reset my password so that I can regain access to my account if I forget it.”

The acceptance criteria might include:
- The user receives a reset link via email.  
- The link expires after 24 hours.  
- The new password must meet security rules (e.g., minimum 8 characters).  
- A confirmation message appears after the password is reset.

These criteria help everyone—from developers to testers—understand exactly what needs to be built and verified. They reduce ambiguity and prevent misunderstandings later.

## 4. Using Sprint Planning to Refine Acceptance Criteria

During Sprint Planning, reviewing and refining acceptance criteria ensures that each user story is clear, feasible, and testable before work begins. This step often leads to great conversations that reveal assumptions or gaps.

For example:
- *Developer:* “The story says users will receive an email—who’s handling the email service?”  
- *Tester:* “Should we test expired links too?”  
- *Product Owner:* “Good question—yes, the link should show an error message if expired.”  

These discussions refine the acceptance criteria and help ensure the team shares a consistent understanding of what’s expected. It’s much easier to clarify details now than to rework code later.

## 5. Strategies for Spotting Dependencies During Sprint Planning

Here are a few practical techniques teams use to uncover dependencies early:

1. **Walk through each story as a group.** Talk through how it will be implemented, who’s involved, and what systems it touches.  
2. **Ask, “What could block this story?”** This helps surface risks or missing prerequisites.  
3. **Use a dependency board or diagram.** Visualizing relationships between stories or teams can reveal hidden connections.  
4. **Involve multiple roles.** Developers, testers, designers, and product owners all see the work from different angles—more perspectives mean fewer surprises.  

By identifying dependencies upfront, you can reorder work, adjust estimates, or communicate with other teams before problems arise.

## 6. Why This Process Matters

Sprint Planning is more than a checklist—it’s a moment of alignment, foresight, and teamwork. When teams take the time to uncover dependencies and refine acceptance criteria, they reduce mid-sprint surprises, improve quality, and build a shared sense of ownership.

Well-run planning sessions save time later, foster open communication, and create a smoother, more predictable sprint experience. In short, they transform planning from a meeting into a powerful collaboration tool.

## 7. Bringing It All Together

Participating fully in Sprint Planning means doing more than just listening—it’s about contributing, asking questions, and thinking ahead. By helping to uncover dependencies and refine acceptance criteria, you make the team stronger and the sprint more successful.

So next time you’re in a Sprint Planning meeting, don’t be shy—speak up when something isn’t clear or when you spot a potential dependency. Those conversations are what turn good sprints into great ones—and good engineers into great collaborators.
