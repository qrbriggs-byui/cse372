# Workshop 3: Documenting Requirements in Agile-Friendly Forms  
**Application Context:** MealMaster – A meal-planning and grocery-list app  
**Duration:** 45 minutes  
**Agile Practice Focus:** Documenting refined user stories, epics, and acceptance tests  
**Power Skill:** Collaborative negotiation and prioritization with stakeholders  

---

## 1. Purpose of This Workshop
In this session, you’ll learn how to capture Agile requirements using **epics**, **refined user stories**, and **acceptance tests**.  
You’ll practice structuring requirements so that they stay clear, testable, and easy to change—without losing the collaborative spirit that drives Agile development.

You’ll keep building on the **MealMaster** backlog created in earlier workshops.

---

## 2. Learning Objectives
By the end of this workshop, you should be able to:
- Explain how Agile documentation differs from traditional requirements documents.  
- Break a large epic into smaller, actionable user stories.  
- Write **acceptance tests** that define “done” for each story.  
- Practice collaborative negotiation when clarifying and refining requirements.

---

## 3. Scenario Background: MealMaster
Your team’s product owner has introduced a new major idea for **MealMaster**:

> “MealMaster should support weekly meal planning with automatic grocery-list generation.”

This feature will become your **epic** for this workshop.  
Your goal is to break it into smaller, refined user stories and define acceptance tests that ensure the feature works as intended.

---

## 4. Workshop Steps (45-Minute Schedule)

### Step 1: Define the Epic (5 minutes)
Working as a team, write a one-sentence description of the epic:  
> “As a student, I want to plan my meals for the week so that I can automatically generate a grocery list.”

Make sure everyone agrees on the overall goal and why it matters to the user.

---

### Step 2: Break the Epic into Refined User Stories (10 minutes)
Brainstorm **3–5 smaller user stories** that make up the epic.  
Use the standard format:  
> “As a [type of user], I want [goal] so that [benefit].”

Example breakdown:
1. “As a student, I want to select meals from a recipe list so that I can plan my week easily.”  
2. “As a student, I want to save my meal plan so that I can review or edit it later.”  
3. “As a student, I want the app to generate a grocery list so that I can buy everything I need.”

Negotiate as a group: Which stories are essential for the first release? Which could wait?  

---

### Step 3: Write Acceptance Tests (15 minutes)
For each user story, write **2–3 acceptance tests** in the **Given/When/Then** format.

Example for “Generate Grocery List”:  
- **Given** a weekly meal plan exists  
- **When** the user selects “Generate Grocery List”  
- **Then** the system displays a list of required ingredients with quantities  

Ensure the tests are realistic, testable, and agreed upon by everyone.  
If the group disagrees on what “success” means, use negotiation to find common ground.

---

### Step 4: Review and Refine (10 minutes)
As a team:
- Check that each story is small, valuable, and testable.  
- Review all acceptance tests for clarity.  
- Confirm that your documentation reflects stakeholder priorities.  
If needed, merge or re-order stories through collaborative discussion.

---

### Step 5: Quick Reflection (5 minutes)
Discuss briefly:
- How did negotiation shape your documentation?  
- Which acceptance criteria required the most clarification?  
- How does this level of documentation support Agile teamwork?  

Record short notes before submitting your deliverables.

Each team will submit:
1. **One Epic** – concise statement of the larger featu
