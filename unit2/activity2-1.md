# Activity 2-1: From Questions to Insights — Practicing Structured and Unstructured Interviews

## 🎯 Purpose
Students will:
- Practice conducting stakeholder interviews using both structured and unstructured approaches.  
- Apply **active listening** and **effective note-taking** techniques to capture accurate requirements.  
- Build confidence asking open-ended, non-leading questions.  
- Learn to summarize and validate findings.

## 🕒 Time Estimate
- Total time: ~45–60 minutes  
  - 10 min: Instructor briefing  
  - 20 min: Structured interview practice  
  - 20 min: Unstructured interview practice  
  - 10 min: Debrief and reflection  

---

## 👥 Setup
- Students form **pairs or small groups** (one interviewer, one stakeholder, one observer/note-taker).  
- Each group chooses or is assigned one **project brief** (see below).  
- Rotate roles after each round so everyone practices interviewing and note-taking.

---

## 🧩 Step 1: Warm-Up Discussion (5–10 min)
Briefly review:
- The difference between **structured** and **unstructured** interviews.  
- The importance of **active listening cues** (paraphrasing, summarizing, asking clarifying questions).  
- The value of **good note-taking** in identifying patterns and hidden requirements.

Encourage students to keep their focus on *understanding the stakeholder’s world* rather than just “checking boxes.”

## 🧱 Step 2: Structured Interview Practice (20 min)

### Instructions
1. Each interviewer uses a **structured script** — 6–8 prewritten questions in a consistent order.  
2. The “stakeholder” answers based on the project brief scenario.  
3. The note-taker captures:
   - **Goals**  
   - **Pain points**  
   - **Requirements** (explicit and implied)  
   - **Follow-up questions**  

### Sample Structured Questions
- What does success look like in your role or this system?  
- Can you walk me through the last time you completed this process?  
- What information do you need at each step?  
- Where do you encounter the most frustration or delays?  
- How do you measure success?  
- If you could change one thing about the current process, what would it be?

Afterward, interviewers should paraphrase and confirm key takeaways to ensure accuracy.

## 🌀 Step 3: Unstructured Interview Practice (20 min)

### Instructions
1. The interviewer puts away the structured list and starts with a few open-ended prompts:
   - “Tell me about the last time this worked really well (or went wrong).”  
   - “What do new people usually struggle with?”  
   - “If I followed you through a day, where might I be surprised?”  
2. The stakeholder answers freely; the interviewer follows the story using **gentle probes** (“Why?”, “How did that start?”, “What happens next?”).  
3. The note-taker focuses on quotes, behaviors, and tacit knowledge — things not explicitly stated but revealed through examples.

Emphasize silence and reflection — interviewers should resist jumping in too soon.

---

## 🧠 Step 4: Debrief and Reflection (10 min)
As a class or in small groups:
- Compare what each interviewer learned using **structured** vs. **unstructured** methods.  
- Discuss which approach uncovered more **tacit requirements** or user insights.  
- Reflect on how **active listening** affected the quality of information gathered.  
- Share one “aha” moment or hidden need that emerged from the conversation.

---

## 📄 Step 5: Post-Activity Deliverable
Each student turns in their notes from when they were interviewing. 
- There should be two sets, one for the structured interview and one for the unstructured interview.

## 🧰 Sample Project Briefs

### 1. Campus Navigation App
Your university wants to design an app to help new students find classrooms, offices, and campus events.  
**Stakeholder options:** Freshman student, campus ambassador, facilities staff.  
**Possible insights:** Need for accessibility, offline maps, or personalized routes.

### 2. Small Business Inventory System
A local bakery wants software to track ingredients, expiration dates, and daily sales.  
**Stakeholder options:** Store owner, baker, cashier.  
**Possible insights:** Daily workflow constraints, preference for mobile over desktop, or seasonal menu changes.

### 3. Virtual Tutoring Platform
An education startup wants to enhance its online tutoring experience for both students and teachers.  
**Stakeholder options:** Tutor, student, or parent.  
**Possible insights:** Scheduling pain points, communication gaps, session tracking, or payment management.

### 4. Public Library Self-Checkout Kiosk
The city library plans to add self-checkout kiosks to reduce wait times.  
**Stakeholder options:** Librarian, frequent visitor, or parent with children.  
**Possible insights:** Accessibility for seniors, error recovery when scanning, or privacy concerns.

---

## 💡 Instructor Tips
- Encourage interviewers to use **mirroring** and **summarizing** statements to confirm understanding (“So you’re saying…?”).  
- Remind stakeholders to stay in character for realism.  
- For bonus depth, have students perform short **role-play debriefs**, where the “stakeholder” explains how the interviewer made them feel heard (or not).  

---

### Outcome
By the end of the session, students will have practiced both **structured rigor** and **unstructured curiosity**, supported by strong **active listening** and **note-taking** habits — the foundation of accurate, empathetic requirements elicitation.
