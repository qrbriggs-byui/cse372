# Instructor Guide: Workshop 3 – Documenting Requirements in Agile-Friendly Forms  
**Application Context:** MealMaster – A meal-planning and grocery-list app  
**Duration:** 45 minutes  
**Focus:** Teaching students to document Agile requirements with epics, refined user stories, and acceptance tests  
**Power Skill:** Collaborative negotiation and prioritization with stakeholders  

---

## 1. Workshop Overview
Students continue developing **MealMaster** by documenting requirements in Agile-friendly formats.  
They’ll define a new **epic**, decompose it into **user stories**, and create **acceptance tests**.  
The emphasis remains on **collaboration and negotiation**—agreeing on scope, clarity, and feasibility.

---

## 2. Learning Outcomes
By the end of the session, students should be able to:
- Write a concise epic that represents a large feature.  
- Decompose an epic into smaller, independent user stories.  
- Develop testable acceptance tests using Given/When/Then.  
- Demonstrate negotiation and emotional intelligence when refining requirements.

## 3. Key Terms to Review (5 minutes)
| Term | Definition |
|------|-------------|
| **Epic** | A large feature or goal too big for one sprint; broken into smaller stories. |
| **User Story** | A short statement capturing user goal and value. |
| **Acceptance Test** | A testable condition that verifies a story meets its criteria for “done.” |
| **Given/When/Then** | A format for writing clear, behavior-focused tests. |
| **Collaborative Negotiation** | Working together to align requirements and balance priorities. |

## 4. 45-Minute Agenda

| Time | Activity | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| 0:00–0:05 | **Introduction** | Introduce the new MealMaster epic (weekly meal planning and auto grocery list). Explain the goal of Agile documentation. |
| 0:05–0:15 | **Define Epic & Break into User Stories** | Teams write one epic and 3–5 smaller stories. Coach for clarity and INVEST criteria (Independent, Valuable, Testable). |
| 0:15–0:30 | **Write Acceptance Tests & Negotiate Details** | Guide students to write 2–3 Given/When/Then tests per story. Play the role of Product Owner to prompt questions and negotiation. |
| 0:30–0:40 | **Review & Refine** | Teams check their stories and tests for clarity and alignment. Encourage discussion on priority and scope. |
| 0:40–0:45 | **Debrief & Wrap-Up** | Facilitate a brief reflection: “What negotiation helped your team reach clarity fastest?” Preview Workshop 4 (prioritization techniques). |

## 5. Instructor Facilitation Tips

### a. Reinforce Agile Documentation Mindset
Explain that Agile requirements should be *light but living*—conversation starters, not contracts.

### b. Play the Product Owner Role
Ask clarifying questions to stimulate negotiation:
- “What would success look like for this story?”  
- “Could this feature be delivered in two sprints instead of one?”  

### c. Observe Negotiation Moments
Watch for how teams handle disagreement about scope or priority.  
Acknowledge examples of empathy and constructive dialogue.

### d. Coach on Acceptance Test Quality
Encourage specificity: each test should be observable and measurable.  
Push students to avoid ambiguous phrases like “It works correctly.”

## 6. Deliverables and Evaluation
Each team submits:
1. **Epic Statement** – one concise sentence describing the large feature.  
2. **3–5 User Stories** – clear and independent.  
3. **2–3 Acceptance Tests per Story** – written in Given/When/Then format.  
4. **Short Reflection (3–4 sentences)** – on negotiation and collaboration.

**Optional Scoring Rubric (10 points total):**
| Category | Points | Criteria |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| Epic & Stories | 4 | Clear, valuable, properly scoped |
| Acceptance Tests | 3 | Testable and complete |
| Reflection | 3 | Shows insight into negotiation and teamwork |

---

## 7. Debrief Discussion Prompts
- Which stories sparked the most debate—and why?  
- How did acceptance tests help clarify expectations?  
- What communication techniques helped resolve confusion?  
- How does negotiation improve the accuracy of documentation?

---

## 8. Key Teaching Points
- Agile requirements evolve through conversation, not contracts.  
- Epics connect high-level goals to actionable stories.  
- Acceptance tests bridge the gap between requirements and verification.   
- Collaborative negotiation ensures documentation reflects shared understanding.  
- Prepares students for **Workshop 4**—applying MoSCoW and WSJF prioritization.
