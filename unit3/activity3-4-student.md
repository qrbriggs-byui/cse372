# Step 4 Activity: Goal–Constraint Mapping

## Overview
In this final step of the unit, you’ll connect your **Business Requirements Document (BRD)** to the broader organizational context.  
You’ll identify how each of your project’s major requirements aligns with the organization’s goals—and how real-world constraints (like time, budget, or technical limits) may impact those goals.

By completing this activity, you’ll learn to think like a systems analyst—balancing what’s *possible* with what’s *practical*.

## Learning Goals
By completing this activity, you will:
- Analyze how project requirements support organizational goals.  
- Identify constraints that could limit project scope or impact outcomes.  
- Communicate how alignment and trade-offs affect project planning.  
- Practice presenting and discussing your findings in a professional setting.

---

## Materials Needed
- Your completed **Business Requirements Document (BRD)**  
- Access to a collaborative workspace (Google Sheet, Jamboard, or whiteboard)  
- The **organizational goals and constraints list** (provided in class or below)  
- Notes from your previous workshop and mapping activities

## Activity Timeline (60 minutes total)

### **1. Review Goals and Constraints (10 minutes)**
Your instructor will provide a list of sample **organizational goals** and **constraints** for the BYU–Idaho I-Center Ticketing System project.

**Example Goals:**
- Improve accessibility and ease of event attendance.  
- Reduce manual administrative workload.  
- Increase digital ticket adoption among students.  
- Ensure system reliability and data security.  
- Enhance customer satisfaction and event engagement.

**Example Constraints:**
- Limited budget for new hardware or external tools.  
- Must integrate with existing university systems.  
- Short development timeline before next event season.  
- Compliance with accessibility and data protection standards.  
- Limited technical support staff post-launch.

Take a few minutes to review these with your group and discuss how they relate to your BRD.

### **2. Goal–Constraint Mapping (30 minutes)**
Work together to connect your **BRD’s major requirements** to these organizational goals and constraints.

**Instructions:**
1. List each high-level requirement from your BRD.  
2. For each requirement, identify:  
   - At least **one organizational goal** it supports.  
   - Any **constraints** that might limit or affect its implementation.  
3. Create a simple **mapping table** to organize your findings.

**Example Table:**

| Requirement | Supported Goal(s) | Constraint(s) |
|--------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Mobile ticket purchase | Increase accessibility; Boost digital adoption | Limited dev time; must integrate with legacy login system |
| Digital ticket scanning | Reduce manual workload; Improve reliability | Must use existing barcode scanners |
| Automated confirmation emails | Improve customer satisfaction | Limited email server capacity |

4. Once your table is complete, review it as a team.  
   - Are there goals without supporting requirements?  
   - Are any requirements not aligned with a clear goal?  
   - Do constraints change how you would prioritize features?  

**Facilitation Tip:**  
Encourage respectful discussion—some disagreement is normal. Focus on understanding how trade-offs shape design choices.

---

### **3. Alignment Discussion and Debrief (20 minutes)**
Each team will share a brief **summary (2–3 minutes)** of their findings with the class.

**Your team’s summary should include:**
- One example of strong alignment between a goal and a requirement.  
- One example of a major constraint that could impact success.  
- A short reflection: “What trade-offs might the team need to consider?”

You may display your mapping table or simply explain key insights.

---

## Deliverables
- **Goal–Constraint Mapping Table** (uploaded to Canvas as a document, slide, or image).  
- A short written summary (one paragraph) reflecting on how alignment and constraints influence project design.  

---

## Tips for Success
- Be specific—link each requirement to goals that clearly relate to user or organizational value.  
- Use concise, actionable language (e.g., “Reduce admin effort by automating ticket validation”).  
- Acknowledge tension between goals and constraints—that’s a normal part of real-world projects.  
- Collaborate actively, but ensure each student understands the group’s reasoning.

## Connection to the Full Unit
This activity completes your **Requirements Workshop → Affinity Mapping → BRD → Goal–Constraint Mapping** sequence.  
Together, these steps simulate the full requirements process from discovery to documentation and alignment—helping you think like both an engineer and a business analyst.
