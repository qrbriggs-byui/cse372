# Step 3 Activity: Writing a Business Requirements Document (BRD)

## Overview
In this activity, you’ll take the work from your previous two sessions—your **requirements workshop** and **affinity mapping exercise**—and turn it into a professional **Business Requirements Document (BRD)**.

A BRD describes *what* the system should accomplish and *why* it matters, without getting into technical implementation details.  
You’ll work in your group to draft content and compare ideas, but **each student will submit their own version** of the BRD to Canvas.

---

## Learning Goals
By completing this activity, you will:
- Translate workshop and affinity map results into a structured, high-level requirements document.  
- Identify business objectives, scope, and high-level requirements aligned with organizational needs.  
- Apply professional writing standards to document requirements clearly and consistently.  
- Practice collaboration and critical thinking while producing your own deliverable.

---

## Materials Needed
- Notes and outputs from:
  - **Mock Workshop Simulation**  
  - **Affinity Mapping Exercise**  
- The reading: *Documenting High-Level Needs in a Business Requirements Document (BRD)*  
- The BRD template (provided below)  
- Word processor or text editor (Google Docs, Word, Markdown, or similar)  

---

## Activity Timeline (60 minutes total)

### **1. Review and Plan (10 minutes)**
1. Rejoin your same group (3–5 members).  
2. Review your group’s **Affinity Map** and discuss key requirement clusters or themes.  
3. Identify:
   - The main **business goals** for the project.  
   - The **core user needs** that emerged from your workshop and clustering activity.  
   - Any **constraints or assumptions** that might affect the project.  

**Facilitation Tip:**  
Use consensus-building techniques from the previous unit to ensure everyone’s voice is heard as you define the project direction.

---

### **2. Draft the BRD Using the Template (40 minutes)**
Use the template below to build your BRD.  
Each student should write and organize their own version, but groups can collaborate and discuss wording, structure, and interpretation.

---

## **Business Requirements Document (BRD) Template**

**Project Name:**  
*Event Ticketing App for the BYU–Idaho I-Center*  

**Date:**  
**Prepared by:**  
*(Your Name)*  

---

### **1. Introduction**
Briefly describe the purpose of this project and what problem it addresses.

*Example:*  
> The purpose of this project is to create an online ticketing system for the BYU–Idaho I-Center that simplifies how users purchase, manage, and validate event tickets while reducing administrative overhead.

---

### **2. Business Objectives**
List 3–5 goals the organization hopes to achieve.  
These should connect to the organizational goals discussed in your readings.

*Example:*  
- Improve accessibility to student and community events.  
- Streamline ticket purchasing and entry processes.  
- Reduce manual record-keeping for event staff.  
- Increase customer satisfaction and attendance.  

---

### **3. Scope**
Define what is included and what is not included in this project.  

*Example:*  
- **In Scope:** Online ticket sales, digital ticket verification, and mobile access.  
- **Out of Scope:** Event catering, merchandise sales, or third-party ticketing platforms.  

---

### **4. Stakeholders**
Identify key people or groups involved in or impacted by the system.

*Example:*  
- **Users:** Students, community members, and staff purchasing event tickets.  
- **Business Owners:** BYU–Idaho Events Office and Financial Services.  
- **Developers:** Campus IT team responsible for implementation and maintenance.

---

### **5. High-Level Requirements**
List the main requirements your system must satisfy.  
Use your affinity map clusters to guide you—each cluster can become a category of requirements.

*Example:*  
- **Usability:** Users must be able to view, purchase, and download tickets easily from mobile and desktop devices.  
- **Automation:** The system must automatically confirm purchases and send receipts via email.  
- **Data Management:** Ticket data must sync with the university’s existing student database.  
- **Security:** Payments must be processed securely and meet PCI compliance standards.  

---

### **6. Assumptions and Constraints**
Note any factors that could affect project success—technical, financial, or operational.

*Example:*  
- The system must integrate with existing campus authentication tools (e.g., student ID login).  
- Project must launch before the next major I-Center event season.  
- Budget is limited to in-house development resources.  

---

### **7. Success Criteria**
Explain how you’ll know the project achieved its goals.  

*Example:*  
- 80% of ticket sales completed online within three months of launch.  
- Event staff report reduced check-in times and fewer errors.  
- Customer satisfaction improves in post-event surveys.

---

### **8. Approval**
Include placeholder lines for stakeholder approval (this section can remain blank for now).  

*Example:*  
**Event Office Director:** _____________________  
**IT Project Lead:** _____________________  
**Financial Manager:** _____________________

### **End of Template**

---

### **3. Submit Your BRD (10 minutes)**
- Save your completed BRD as a **.docx**, **.pdf**, or **.md** file.  
- Each student must **submit their own copy** to Canvas, even if the content was developed collaboratively.  
- Before submitting, review your document to ensure:
  - All required sections are included.  
  - Content connects to the workshop and affinity mapping results.  
  - The document uses clear, professional language.

---

## Deliverables
- One **Business Requirements Document (BRD)** per student, based on group discussion.  
- Each BRD should follow the template and reflect:
  - The outcomes of the **Workshop** and **Affinity Mapping** sessions.  
  - A clear connection to the business goals described in the reading.

---

## Tips for Success
- **Collaborate, then individualize:** Work together for shared understanding, but write your own version in your own words.  
- **Stay high-level:** Focus on *what* the system must do and *why*, not *how* it will be implemented.  
- **Be specific where possible:** Use measurable language for objectives and requirements.  
- **Review your reading:** Follow the structure and examples from *Documenting High-Level Needs in a BRD*.

## Connection to Next Step
This document will serve as the foundation for **Step 4: Goal–Constraint Mapping**, where you’ll evaluate how your proposed requirements align with organizational priorities and limitations.
