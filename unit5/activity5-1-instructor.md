## 4. 45-Minute Agenda

| Time | Activity | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| 0:00–0:05 | **Introduction** | Briefly introduce backlog grooming and its purpose. Define “user story,” “backlog,” and “MoSCoW.” Explain the MealMaster scenario. |
| 0:05–0:15 | **Write Refined User Stories** | Students create 4–6 stories from the stakeholder list. Circulate to ensure proper format and focus on user value. |
| 0:15–0:25 | **Grooming Discussion** | Teams review, merge, or split stories. Observe negotiation moments; remind students to listen actively and respect differing viewpoints. |
| 0:25–0:35 | **Apply MoSCoW Prioritization** | Teams categorize stories and justify decisions. Prompt them to discuss trade-offs and business vs. technical perspectives. |
| 0:35–0:45 | **Reflection and Wrap-Up** | Teams share a short insight or challenge encountered. Discuss how emotional intelligence influenced the group’s collaboration. |

## 5. Instructor Facilitation Tips

### a. Encourage Active Listening and Negotiation
Remind students that grooming is about reaching shared understanding.  
Ask prompting questions:
- “How does this story create value for users?”  
- “Could this feature wait for a later release?”  
- “How might we balance technical effort with business need?”

### b. Model Emotional Intelligence
When you see disagreement, model empathy and curiosity:
- “I hear both perspectives—let’s find common ground.”  
Encourage teams to phrase disagreement as curiosity (“Help me understand why you think that…”).

### c. Keep the Pace Tight
Because this is a 45-minute session, gently timebox each step.  
Remind teams to focus on *clarity, not perfection*—they will refine further in future workshops.

## 6. Deliverables and Evaluation
Each team should submit:
1. **Refined User Story List (4–6 stories)**  
2. **MoSCoW Chart** – logically justified.  
3. **Short Reflection Summary** – describing negotiation and collaboration.

**Optional Scoring Rubric (out of 10 points):**
| Category | Points | Criteria |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| User stories | 4 | Clear, actionable, and valuable |
| Prioritization | 3 | Logical MoSCoW categorization |
| Reflection | 3 | Insightful and demonstrates collaboration awareness |
