# Instructor Guide: Building Low-Fidelity Prototypes to Elicit Clarifications

**Duration:** 45 minutes  
**Audience:** Undergraduate software engineering or requirements-gathering students  
**Workshop Theme:** Using low-fidelity prototypes to visualize ideas and gather early user feedback.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the workshop, students should be able to:
1. Translate user goals into simple visual prototypes.  
2. Use low-fidelity sketches to clarify ambiguous requirements.  
3. Communicate design ideas using visual and textual formats.  
4. Incorporate peer feedback to refine early designs.

---

## Preparation
- Review examples of **wireframes** and **clickable mockups** from tools like Figma, Balsamiq, or Adobe XD.  
- Prepare a short presentation slide showing:  
  - Example low-fidelity wireframes.  
  - Poor vs. clear layout examples.  
  - A reminder that prototypes are about **structure and flow, not decoration**:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.  
- Provide students with paper, markers, or access to digital tools.

## Session Breakdown (45 minutes)

### **1. Introduction (5 minutes)**
- Briefly explain how low-fidelity prototypes help teams move from abstract ideas to tangible discussions.  
- Reinforce that unfinished visuals encourage honest feedback and foster collaboration:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}.  
- Connect this to earlier work on **user surveys**: now students will visualize what users described.  

**Instructor Tip:**  
Remind students that clarity—not beauty—is the goal. Encourage them to focus on layout, structure, and usability.

---

### **2. Define User Goals (10 minutes)**
- Guide students in identifying 2–3 main user goals for the course planning app.  
- Encourage them to phrase goals as user stories (e.g., “As a student, I want to…”):contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}.  
- Walk around to ensure goals are actionable and represent key user needs.  

**Prompt Questions:**  
- What problem are you solving for the user?  
- What should the user be able to accomplish on this screen?

---

### **3. Sketch Wireframes (15 minutes)**
- Students create rough drafts using boxes and labels—no colors or graphics.  
- Encourage simple annotations to explain intent (e.g., “This button adds a class”).  
- Circulate and prompt teams to think about layout and navigation flow.  

**Instructor Demonstration:**  
Show how to connect three sketches with arrows to visualize navigation (e.g., from home page to course selection to confirmation).

**Observation Focus:**  
- Are screens organized logically?  
- Do elements align with user goals?  
- Are labels clear and consistent?

---

### **4. Add Navigation and Test (10 minutes)**
- Pair groups to test each other’s prototypes.  
- Have testers “walk through” the flow and verbalize their thought process (“I would click here next…”).  
- Students record feedback on clarity and usability.  

**Instructor Tip:**  
Observe quietly at first—watch for confusion, hesitation, or mismatched expectations between the design and its description.

---

### **5. Reflection and Wrap-Up (5 minutes)**
- Bring everyone back together. Ask:  
  - “What surprised you during testing?”  
  - “What did you change or clarify after feedback?”  
- Reinforce how **visual artifacts** like prototypes enhance understanding when combined with **textual explanations**:contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}.

---

## Assessment and Follow-Up

**During Class:** Evaluate teams on:  
- Completeness (3+ connected screens)  
- Logical flow and clarity  
- Evidence of incorporating peer feedback  
- Use of both visuals and brief textual explanations  

**After Class:** Students can refine prototypes digitally and add annotations for their project portfolio or next assignment (transforming them into user stories and acceptance criteria).

---

## Communication Emphasis

Remind students that strong requirement communication combines:  
- **Visual clarity** (clear layouts, logical flows).  
- **Textual explanation** (concise annotations, user stories).  

Encourage them to think of prototypes as shared languages that bridge developers, designers, and users.
