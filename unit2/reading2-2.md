# How to Conduct Observations or Job Shadowing to Capture Workflows and Tacit Requirements

When I first shadowed a warehouse employee for a software redesign project, I thought I’d just be watching people scan barcodes. Within ten minutes, I realized how much of the real work never showed up in the documentation — handwritten notes, side conversations, and even small gestures that made the system function smoothly. That’s the beauty of **observations and job shadowing**: they reveal the *tacit requirements* — the unspoken details of how work actually gets done.

## Why Observe?

Observation lets you see the gap between how people *say* they do their work and how they *really* do it. Interviews are valuable, but people often skip details because they’ve become second nature. Watching them in action uncovers shortcuts, pain points, and clever workarounds that never make it into official workflows.

**Example:**  
A nurse told a design team she “just enters patient notes.” But during observation, they noticed she had to write reminders on sticky notes first because the system logged her out too quickly. That tiny behavior revealed a usability issue no interview would have caught.

## Preparing for Observation

Before you start shadowing, do a little homework:

1. **Set a goal:**  
   What do you hope to learn? Workflow? Bottlenecks? Environmental constraints?
2. **Choose participants wisely:**  
   Observe a mix of experts and newcomers — they see the same system in different ways.
3. **Get permission:**  
   Always inform participants and their supervisors. Be clear that your goal is to learn, not to evaluate performance.
4. **Plan your tools:**  
   Bring a small notebook or tablet for notes. Photos or screen captures (if allowed) can be priceless for recalling layouts and steps.

**Pro tip:** If possible, run a short pilot observation first to test your note-taking setup and confirm you’re focusing on the right details.

## During the Observation

### 1. Blend In, Don’t Interrupt
Be a quiet presence at first. Stand where you can see the work but not block anyone’s flow. Let the rhythm of the job guide your attention.

### 2. Take Smart Notes
Capture **what you see and hear**, not just what people say they do. Look for:
- Tools and interfaces used  
- Physical environment (noise, lighting, interruptions)  
- Workarounds (“I just do this to make it faster”)  
- Interactions between people and systems  

Use a simple format like:
> **Task:** Submitting a form  
> **Observation:** User re-enters ID twice due to timeout  
> **Tacit insight:** System timing conflicts with real-world pace  

### 3. Ask Clarifying Questions (At the Right Time)
Wait for natural pauses before asking:  
> “Can you walk me through why you do that step?”  
> “What happens if you skip this?”  

The goal isn’t to interrogate — it’s to understand intent behind behavior.

## Turning Observation into Insights

Afterward, debrief while it’s fresh. Summarize:
- Major **steps** in the workflow  
- Observed **pain points** and **workarounds**  
- Potential **requirements** these suggest (e.g., “System must stay active during short interruptions”)  
- Questions still unanswered  

If you observed multiple people, compare notes. Are the patterns consistent or role-specific?

**Example:**  
A developer shadowed three customer service reps. Two used the official CRM tool, but one preferred a personal spreadsheet because the CRM froze too often. That inconsistency revealed a hidden requirement: improve system performance during peak hours.

## Capturing Tacit Requirements

Tacit requirements are the *invisible glue* — the norms, gestures, and expectations people rarely articulate:
- How they coordinate without talking (“If she prints the form, I know it’s ready.”)  
- How they signal urgency (highlighting names, sticky notes, tone of voice)  
- How they avoid mistakes (double-checking certain steps instinctively)

Document these in plain language:  
> “Users rely on color-coded folders as a visual reminder of task status.”  

Later, these details can inspire interface cues, automated alerts, or streamlined workflows that fit naturally with users’ habits.

## Wrapping Up

Send a quick thank-you message to those you observed, and — if possible — share a short summary of what you learned. People appreciate seeing how their daily experience contributes to system improvements.

**Remember:**  
Observation isn’t about catching errors; it’s about *catching reality.* When you take the time to see how work truly happens, you uncover the quiet details that turn decent designs into great ones.

**Bottom line:**  
Job shadowing and observation bridge the gap between process charts and lived experience. The next time you shadow someone, look beyond what’s on the screen — watch their eyes, their hands, and even the pauses between clicks. That’s where the real requirements hide.
