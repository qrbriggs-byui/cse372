# How to Conduct Structured and Unstructured Stakeholder Interviews

*A practical, people-first guide—with stories, sample questions, and simple habits that build trust.*

On my first real stakeholder interview, I brought a page of carefully numbered questions. Five minutes in, my interviewee laughed and said, "You can put that paper down—I'll just tell you how the work really gets done." I learned two things that day: structure keeps you honest, and flexibility keeps you human. The best interviewers use both.

## What's the difference?

**Structured interviews** follow a consistent script. Everyone gets the same core questions, in roughly the same order. This makes responses easier to compare and helps you avoid missing critical topics.

**Unstructured interviews** feel more like a guided conversation. You start with a goal and a few prompts, then follow the stakeholder's language, stories, and surprises. You discover tacit knowledge—the stuff nobody thought to write down.

> **Rule of thumb:** Use structure to ensure coverage; use curiosity to uncover context.

## Before you start: prepare like a pro

- **Set a purpose:** What decisions will this interview inform? Write a one-sentence goal you can share.
- **Choose a style:** If you need comparability (e.g., across many roles), lean structured. If you're exploring a new domain, start unstructured.
- **Draft a spine:** Create 6–10 "must-ask" questions (your structured core) and a few prompts ("Tell me about…") for freeform exploration.
- **Mind the logistics:** Get consent to record, schedule enough time (30–60 min), and confirm accessibility needs.

## Running a structured interview

### Use a consistent flow

- **Warm-up:** "Could you describe your role and a typical day?"
- **Key tasks:** "Walk me through how you do *X* from start to finish."
- **Pain points:** "Where do delays, errors, or workarounds happen?"
- **Measures & constraints:** "How do you know it's successful? Any rules, policies, or SLAs you must meet?"
- **Wish list:** "If you could wave a magic wand, what would you change first?"

### Keep it neutral, keep it comparable

- **Avoid leading:** Ask "What information do you need on this screen?" not "Do you need a bigger search box?"
- **Clarify terms:** "When you say 'ticket,' is that the same as a 'case' in your tool?"
- **Time-box politely:** If a tangent grows, say "That's helpful—I'll note it and come back if time allows."

> **Mini anecdote:** A team interviewing dispatchers used an identical set of 12 questions across three sites. Because they kept the structure, they spotted one location's unique constraint—radio dead zones—that never surfaced elsewhere. Structure made the difference.

## Running an unstructured interview

### Follow the story

Start with an open door: "Tell me about the last time this went really well—or really badly." Then reflect back what you hear: "So when the inventory arrives late, you update the spreadsheet and text the floor lead. Did I get that right?"

### Use gentle probes

- **Why/How ladder:** "Why do you do it that way?" → "How did that process start?" → "What would happen if you skipped it?"
- **Exceptions:** "When does the usual process break?"
- **Artifacts:** "Could I see the template, email, or note you use?"
- **Numbers:** "About how often does that happen in a week?"

*Anecdote:* During a "casual chat" with a warehouse lead, we noticed a laminated cheat sheet taped to a forklift. No one had mentioned it in structured sessions. That one artifact explained a tricky barcode workaround—and saved the team from designing the wrong scanner flow.

## Blending both styles (the sweet spot)

Most great interviews are **semi-structured**: you bring a core script for coverage and wander thoughtfully for discovery. Try this rhythm:

- Open with context and permission: "I'll ask 8–10 standard questions, and we may chase a few examples along the way."
- Use the script to anchor each section, then invite a story: "Can you share a recent example?"
- Close the loop: "We covered tasks, pain points, and success measures. Anything we missed?"

## Active listening (your superpower)

- **Mirror & label:** "It sounds like the last-minute requests create stress."
- **Summarize often:** "Let me recap the steps to be sure I have them right…"
- **Embrace silence:** A few seconds of quiet often surfaces the detail you needed.

> "If a stakeholder feels heard, they'll tell you what they really need—not just what they think you want to hear."

## After the interview: make the value visible

- **Tag your notes:** Mark quotes as pain points, goals, constraints, metrics, or ideas.
- **Create a quick readout:** 1-page summary with top insights, open questions, and next steps.
- **Trace to requirements:** Turn findings into user stories, acceptance criteria, or use cases while the details are fresh.
- **Say thanks:** Send a brief thank-you and, when possible, how their input shaped the design. Trust compounds.

## Starter kits you can reuse

### Structured core (edit to fit)

- Role & goals: "What does success look like in your role?"
- Workflow: "Walk me through the last time you completed *X*."
- Information needs: "What info do you need at each step?"
- Pain points: "Where do delays, errors, or handoffs go wrong?"
- Constraints: "Policies, tools, or metrics that shape the work?"
- Improvements: "If we fixed one thing this quarter, what should it be?"

### Unstructured prompts (pull as needed)

- "Tell me a story about the last time this was hard."
- "What do new teammates usually get wrong at first?"
- "What's the 'unwritten rule' everyone knows but nobody documents?"
- "If I shadowed you for an hour, where would I be surprised?"

*Bottom line:* Structured interviews give you coverage; unstructured interviews give you color. Blend them, listen deeply, and you'll leave every conversation with clearer requirements and stronger relationships.
