# Instructor Guide: Workshop 4 – Applying Prioritization Techniques (MoSCoW & WSJF)  
**Application Context:** MealMaster – A meal-planning and grocery-list app  
**Duration:** 45 minutes  
**Focus:** Teaching qualitative and quantitative prioritization in Agile contexts  
**Power Skill:** Collaborative negotiation and prioritization with stakeholders  

---

## 1. Workshop Overview
This workshop introduces two Agile prioritization frameworks: **MoSCoW** and **WSJF (Weighted Shortest Job First)**.  
Students will use their **MealMaster** backlog to decide what features to build first for the next release.  

The activity emphasizes both **analytical decision-making** and **collaborative negotiation**, helping students balance stakeholder value with technical feasibility.

---

## 2. Learning Outcomes
By the end of the session, students should be able to:
- Apply MoSCoW and WSJF to prioritize user stories.  
- Differentiate between qualitative and quantitative prioritization.  
- Justify decisions using both value and effort considerations.  
- Demonstrate negotiation and emotional intelligence when aligning on priorities.

## 3. Key Terms to Review (5 minutes)
| Term | Definition |
|------|-------------|
| **Prioritization** | The process of deciding which backlog items to work on first. |
| **MoSCoW** | A qualitative technique that categorizes work as Must, Should, Could, or Won’t have. |
| **WSJF** | A quantitative method for ranking features by dividing Cost of Delay by Job Size. |
| **Cost of Delay** | The impact of delaying a feature—measured in lost value, opportunity, or satisfaction. |
| **Collaborative Negotiation** | A process of aligning perspectives through discussion and compromise. |

## 4. 45-Minute Agenda

| Time | Activity | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| 0:00–0:05 | **Introduction** | Review purpose of prioritization in Agile. Define MoSCoW and WSJF. |
| 0:05–0:15 | **MoSCoW Activity** | Teams categorize stories from their MealMaster backlog. Prompt them to justify their choices and discuss trade-offs. |
| 0:15–0:30 | **WSJF Calculation** | Students assign numeric values for Cost of Delay and Job Size. Walk through at least one example calculation. |
| 0:30–0:40 | **Compare and Negotiate Priorities** | Have teams compare MoSCoW vs. WSJF results. Facilitate discussion on discrepancies. Encourage negotiation to reach consensus. |
| 0:40–0:45 | **Debrief and Reflection** | Quick group share: “What did you learn about balancing value and effort?” Preview course wrap-up or retrospective. |

## 5. Instructor Facilitation Tips

### a. Emphasize Contextual Thinking
Remind students that neither method is “perfect.”  
Encourage them to use MoSCoW for quick collaboration and WSJF for deeper analysis.

### b. Coach Teams Through Disagreements
Play the Product Owner role to create realistic tension:
- “Marketing insists that recipe sharing is essential—what do you think?”  
- “Engineering says that’s too complex right now—how can we compromise?”

Highlight empathy and communication as key to resolving such discussions.

### c. Support WSJF Calculations
If teams struggle, simplify the math:
- Keep Cost of Delay and Job Size on a 1–5 or 1–8 scale.  
- Emphasize *relative* comparison, not exact precision.

### d. Observe and Reinforce Negotiation Skills
Look for examples of respectful disagreement, clear reasoning, and team compromise.  
Recognize teams that use data to justify decisions *and* consider stakeholder perspectives.

## 6. Deliverables and Evaluation
Each team should submit:
1. **MoSCoW Table** – with categories and rationale  
2. **WSJF Calculation Table** – with Cost of Delay, Job Size, and WSJF score  
3. **Final Prioritized Backlog** – in ranked order  
4. **Short Reflection** – on negotiation and decision-making process  

**Optional Scoring Rubric (out of 10 points):**
| Category | Points | Criteria |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| MoSCoW Table | 3 | Logical categorization and justification |
| WSJF Table | 3 | Accurate calculations and prioritization |
| Final Backlog | 2 | Clear, realistic ordering |
| Reflection | 2 | Insight into teamwork and negotiation |

## 7. Debrief Discussion Prompts
Use these at the end of class or in a short write-up:
- How did your team balance intuition and data when prioritizing?  
- What disagreements arose—and how were they resolved?  
- Which method (MoSCoW or WSJF) felt more useful in your context?  
- How might these techniques change when working with real stakeholders?

---

## 8. Key Teaching Points
- MoSCoW enables fast, qualitative prioritization.  
- WSJF introduces quantitative rigor by weighing value vs. effort.  
- Combining both methods provides balanced decision-making.  
- Negotiation ensures priorities reflect both stakeholder needs and team realities.  
- This workshop closes the Agile requirements sequence, setting the stage for project retrospectives or implementation planning.
