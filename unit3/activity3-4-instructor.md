# Instructor Guide: Step 4 — Goal–Constraint Mapping

## Overview
This final session in the unit helps students connect their **Business Requirements Document (BRD)** to real organizational priorities and limits.  
Students identify how each high-level requirement supports a business goal and how constraints may affect its implementation.  

By the end of class, students will understand how to evaluate alignment, recognize trade-offs, and communicate design decisions clearly.

---

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, students will be able to:
- Analyze how project requirements align with organizational goals.  
- Identify constraints that limit scope or influence decisions.  
- Communicate alignment and trade-offs in a professional discussion.  
- Reflect on how requirements decisions affect business outcomes.

## Class Duration — 60 Minutes
| Segment | Time | Purpose |
|----------|------|----------|
| Introduction & Setup | 10 min | Provide goals/constraints and review expectations |
| Goal–Constraint Mapping | 30 min | Students connect BRD requirements to goals and limits |
| Discussion & Debrief | 20 min | Teams share findings and reflect on alignment trade-offs |

---

## Preparation Before Class
- Review the reading *Connecting Workshop Results to Organizational Goals and Constraints*.  
- Prepare a short list of **sample goals and constraints** for the BYU–Idaho I-Center ticketing system.  
- Ensure students have access to their previously completed BRD.  
- Create a Canvas submission area for the **Goal–Constraint Mapping Table + Summary** deliverable.  
- Optional: prepare slides summarizing key terms (goal vs. constraint vs. requirement).

---

## Materials Needed
- List of organizational goals and constraints (print or project on screen)  
- Students’ BRDs (digital or printed)  
- Shared workspace (Jamboard, Google Docs, whiteboard, or table paper)  
- Timer or clock

## Facilitation Plan

### **1. Introduction & Setup (10 Minutes)**
**Purpose:** Frame the activity and recall why goal alignment matters.

**Instructor Notes:**
- Begin with a recap of the unit sequence:  
  > “You’ve defined requirements—now we’ll make sure they align with the organization’s goals and practical limits.”  
- Explain the two key concepts:  
  - *Goals* = what the organization wants to achieve.  
  - *Constraints* = the limits that shape how those goals can be met.  
- Distribute or display the prepared goal and constraint lists.  
- Clarify deliverables: students will create a mapping table and a short written reflection for Canvas submission.

### **2. Goal–Constraint Mapping (30 Minutes)**
**Purpose:** Students analyze their BRD and evaluate alignment.

**Instructions to Give:**
1. Rejoin your project teams.  
2. Review each high-level requirement from your BRD.  
3. Identify at least one goal that each requirement supports.  
4. Identify any constraint that might limit or affect that requirement.  
5. Discuss trade-offs and note where alignment is weak or strong.  
6. Prepare a concise written summary (1 paragraph) of insights.

**Instructor Tips:**
- Circulate among groups and ask probing questions:  
  - “How does this requirement help the organization meet its top priority?”  
  - “What constraint could delay or complicate that goal?”  
  - “Which of these trade-offs would you prioritize?”  
- Encourage healthy debate; remind students that misalignment can reveal gaps.  
- Emphasize evidence-based reasoning—students should point to specific BRD statements.  

---

### **3. Discussion & Debrief (20 Minutes)**
**Purpose:** Allow groups to share insights and reflect collectively.

**Instructions to Give:**
- Invite each team to present a short verbal debrief (2–3 minutes).  
  - Highlight one example of strong alignment.  
  - Identify one major constraint that affects implementation.  
  - Conclude with a brief takeaway or trade-off observation.  
- Facilitate group reflection after all teams share.

**Discussion Prompts:**
- Which goals were easiest or hardest to align with?  
- How did constraints change your perception of project feasibility?  
- What strategies could help balance user needs with organizational limits?  
- How can goal–constraint analysis improve future requirements work?

**Instructor Summary:**
- Reinforce that this activity mirrors real-world feasibility analysis.  
- Emphasize that every project requires balancing ambition with limitation.  
- Connect to professional practice: aligning to strategy is as important as meeting technical specs.

## Assessment Guidelines
**Deliverables:**
- Group **Goal–Constraint Mapping Table**  
- Short **Written Summary** (each student submits individually)

**Suggested Evaluation (10 Points):**
| Criteria | Excellent (Full Credit) | Developing | Needs Improvement |
|-----------|------------------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Completeness (3 pts)** | All major requirements mapped to goals and constraints | Some omissions | Few or unclear mappings |
| **Quality of Analysis (4 pts)** | Demonstrates clear reasoning and recognizes trade-offs | Reasoning mostly sound; limited depth | Minimal justification or vague reasoning |
| **Collaboration (2 pts)** | Evidence of team discussion and consensus | Partial collaboration | Disorganized or incomplete teamwork |
| **Professional Presentation (1 pt)** | Clear, readable format and well-written summary | Some minor clarity issues | Disorganized or incomplete submission |

---

## Instructor Tips for Success
- **Encourage depth, not quantity:** One strong example per requirement is better than many weak ones.  
- **Highlight connections:** Reinforce the link between this mapping and the earlier BRD sections.  
- **Balance optimism and realism:** Ask, “If this constraint stays, what could you still deliver?”  
- **End on reflection:** Have students consider how constraints drive innovation rather than limit it.

## Connection to the Full Unit
This final activity completes the sequence:  
1. **Workshop & Brainstorming** → Generate perspectives  
2. **Affinity Mapping** → Organize ideas  
3. **BRD Drafting** → Document high-level needs  
4. **Goal–Constraint Mapping** → Align with organizational strategy  

Together, these activities simulate a professional requirements engineering process—from elicitation through documentation and validation.
