# Activity 2-4: Conducting a Competitive Analysis Informed by User Insights

## 🎯 Purpose
In this activity, students will practice performing a **competitive analysis** informed by real or hypothetical user research.  
They will identify **2–3 competing products**, analyze **features, usability, and market positioning**, and highlight **opportunities for innovation** based on user pain points and unmet needs.

This activity helps students connect **user-centered insights** to **strategic product comparisons**, just as described in the reading *How to Perform a Competitive Analysis Informed by Real User Insights*【111†source】.

---

## 🧠 Learning Goals
- Identify **direct, indirect, and aspirational competitors** for a given product idea.  
- Compare **features**, **usability**, and **emotional tone** across competing products.  
- Relate findings to **user pain points and opportunities** discovered in interviews or observations.  
- Present actionable recommendations that demonstrate understanding of **user-driven innovation**.

---

## 🕒 Time Estimate
- 10 minutes — Review activity goals and assign products  
- 30–40 minutes — Conduct competitive analysis in small groups  
- 15 minutes — Prepare and deliver short presentations  
- 10 minutes — Debrief and group discussion  

---

## 👥 Group Setup
- Work in **teams of 3–4 students**.  
- Each team chooses one of the following topics (or one approved by the instructor):  
  - A mobile budgeting app  
  - A meal delivery platform  
  - A fitness or wellness tracker  
  - A language learning application  
  - A local business booking system (e.g., salons, repair services)  

Each team will identify **2–3 competing products** to analyze within their chosen domain.

---

## 🧩 Step 1: Identify Competitors (10 min)
Choose 2–3 products that represent different types of competition:
- **Direct competitors** – offer the same product/service to the same audience.  
- **Indirect competitors** – serve similar needs in a different way.  
- **Aspirational competitors** – not in the same industry but excel in user experience or engagement.

Example: For a fitness tracker, you might analyze Strava (direct), Apple Fitness (indirect), and Duolingo (aspirational, for motivation design).

---

## 📊 Step 2: Compare Features and Usability (20–25 min)
Using the **template below**, students evaluate:
- **Core Features** – What each product offers that aligns with user needs.  
- **Usability** – Ease of navigation, clarity of interface, accessibility, and emotional tone.  
- **Unique Strengths** – Areas where the product stands out.  
- **Gaps or Frustrations** – Where users might still struggle or feel limited.

Be sure to connect your analysis to **real or assumed user pain points** from prior interviews or observations【111†source】.

## 🧾 Competitive Analysis Template

| **Category** | **Competitor A** | **Competitor B** | **Competitor C** | **Observations / Notes** |
|---------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|---------------------------|
| **Core Features** | | | | |
| **Ease of Use / Navigation** | | | | |
| **Emotional Tone (feel, trust, motivation)** | | | | |
| **Visual Design & Accessibility** | | | | |
| **Pricing / Monetization Model** | | | | |
| **Performance / Reliability** | | | | |
| **Support / Help Options** | | | | |
| **Identified User Pain Points** | | | | |
| **Opportunities for Innovation or Improvement** | | | | |

*Tip:* Pay special attention to the **user experience** beyond features — clarity, feedback, tone, and emotional cues all influence perception【111†source】.

## 💡 Step 3: Identify Opportunities (10–15 min)
After completing the matrix, discuss and summarize:
- What are the most common **pain points** across all competitors?  
- What needs are still **unmet** or under-served?  
- What features or experiences could your product offer to stand apart?  

Frame your findings as **opportunities for innovation**, not just gaps in features.

---

## 🗣 Step 4: Present Your Findings (15 min)
Each group gives a **5–7 minute presentation** summarizing their analysis. Include:
- A visual or summarized **comparison table**.  
- 2–3 **key insights** drawn from observed user pain points.  
- 1–2 **recommendations for innovation** grounded in user needs.  

Presentations should emphasize *why* a certain feature or approach would improve user satisfaction or usability.

---

## 🧭 Step 5: Reflect and Discuss (10 min)
After all presentations, discuss as a class:
- How did user insights change what you paid attention to in competitors?  
- Were there any “aha” moments where you noticed all competitors overlooked the same need?  
- How might these findings guide your next steps in product or feature design?

---

## 📦 Deliverables
Each team submits:
1. A completed **Competitive Analysis Matrix** (template above).  
2. A one-page **summary** highlighting:  
   - Major user pain points.  
   - Key competitive differentiators.  
   - Opportunities for innovation.  
3. (Optional) Slides from their brief presentation.

---

### ✅ Outcome
By the end of this activity, students will have:
- Practiced using **competitive analysis** as a strategic design tool.  
- Learned to evaluate competitors through the lens of **user experience and emotion**.  
- Developed skills in identifying **innovation opportunities** grounded in real user pain points【111†source】.
