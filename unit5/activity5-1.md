## 3. Scenario Background: MealMaster
Your team has been asked to design **MealMaster**, an app that helps students plan meals and generate shopping lists.  
The Product Owner has shared the following stakeholder requests:

- “It should suggest meals for the week.”  
- “We need grocery list features.”  
- “It should show nutrition info.”  
- “Make it easy to share recipes with friends.”  
- “Let it auto-sync with supermarket inventory.”  

Your task is to turn these rough ideas into a **refined product backlog** for the MealMaster Minimum Viable Product (MVP).
