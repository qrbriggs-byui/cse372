### **1. Practice structured and unstructured stakeholder interviews**

**Activities:**

* **Mock interviews:** Students take turns acting as stakeholders (e.g., clients, end users) and interviewers. Provide sample project briefs to guide questioning.
* **Question design workshop:** Students develop both structured (prepared) and unstructured (open-ended) questions, then critique each other’s interview plans.
* **Interview reflection journal:** After conducting interviews, students summarize what went well, what they learned, and how they could improve communication.

### **2. Conduct observations or job shadowing to capture workflows and tacit requirements**

**Activities:**

* **Observation simulation:** Observe a classmate performing a task (e.g., booking a ticket, using software) and document the steps, challenges, and unspoken assumptions.
* **Real-world observation:** Visit a local business, lab, or office (with permission) to observe real workflows and identify inefficiencies or unmet needs.
* **Workflow diagramming:** Use the observation data to create process maps or swimlane diagrams that visualize how tasks are performed.

### **3. Translate elicitation data into use cases that describe user interactions**

**Activities:**

* **Use case writing exercise:** Provide interview or observation notes and have students draft detailed use cases including actors, preconditions, triggers, and main flows.
* **Peer review session:** Exchange use cases in pairs, reviewing clarity, completeness, and realism.
* **Use case modeling:** Create corresponding UML use case diagrams to visually represent the system boundaries and actors.

### **4. Perform a competitive analysis to identify features and gaps informed by interview/observation insights**

**Activities:**

* **Competitor research assignment:** Students identify 2–3 competing products and compare features, usability, and market positioning.
* **Feature matrix creation:** Build a table comparing features across competitors, noting which align with stakeholder needs identified during interviews.
* **Gap analysis presentation:** Students present findings highlighting opportunities for innovation or improvement based on observed user pain points.

### **5. Apply active listening and note-taking skills to capture accurate requirements**

**Activities:**

* **Listening challenge:** Play a short stakeholder “interview” video/audio and have students take notes; then compare notes to check accuracy and completeness.
* **Paraphrasing exercise:** Students practice summarizing what a “stakeholder” just said to confirm understanding (“So you’re saying that…”).
* **Collaborative debrief:** After mock interviews, teams combine and reconcile their notes to produce a unified set of requirements, emphasizing accuracy and clarity.
