# Workshop 4: Applying Prioritization Techniques (MoSCoW & WSJF)  
**Application Context:** MealMaster – A meal-planning and grocery-list app  
**Duration:** 45 minutes  
**Agile Practice Focus:** Applying qualitative and quantitative prioritization techniques  
**Power Skill:** Collaborative negotiation and prioritization with stakeholders  

---

## 1. Purpose of This Workshop
In this session, you’ll learn how to apply two powerful Agile prioritization methods—**MoSCoW** and **WSJF (Weighted Shortest Job First)**—to decide what features should be developed first.  

You’ll practice analyzing value, effort, and dependencies, and you’ll use negotiation to align your team’s decisions with stakeholder priorities.

---

## 2. Learning Objectives
By the end of this workshop, you should be able to:
- Explain the purpose of prioritization in Agile environments.  
- Apply the **MoSCoW** and **WSJF** techniques to order backlog items.  
- Balance business value, user impact, and effort when making trade-offs.  
- Demonstrate collaborative negotiation to reach shared prioritization decisions.

---

## 3. Scenario Background: MealMaster
Your team’s **MealMaster** backlog now includes several refined user stories and acceptance tests.  
The Product Owner has asked your team to determine which stories will provide the **most value in the next release**.  

You’ll first revisit your **MoSCoW** categories from earlier workshops and then use **WSJF** to make data-informed prioritization decisions.

---

## 4. Workshop Steps (45-Minute Schedule)

### Step 1: Review the Backlog (5 minutes)
Look at your list of **refined user stories** from Workshop 3.  
Discuss briefly which ones are still top priorities for the next release.

Example MealMaster stories:
- Plan meals for the week  
- Generate a grocery list  
- View nutrition information  
- Save favorite recipes  
- Share meal plans with friends  

---

### Step 2: Apply MoSCoW Prioritization (10 minutes)
As a team, categorize your stories using **MoSCoW**:

| Category | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Must have** | Critical to core functionality |
| **Should have** | Important but not vital |
| **Could have** | Nice to include later |
| **Won’t have (for now)** | Deferred features |

Discuss and negotiate your choices.  
Ask: *Which features will make the biggest impact on user satisfaction or MVP success?*  

---

### Step 3: Calculate WSJF Scores (15 minutes)
Next, apply **Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF)** to rank your stories quantitatively.

The formula:  
> **WSJF = Cost of Delay ÷ Job Size**

- **Cost of Delay (CoD):** Represents how much value or urgency is lost if the feature is delayed.  
- **Job Size:** The estimated effort or complexity (use story points or a 1–8 scale).  

Example:

| Feature | Cost of Delay | Job Size | WSJF = CoD / Job Size | Rank |
|----------|----------------|-----------|------------------------|------|
| Meal Planning | 20 | 5 | 4.0 | 2 |
| Grocery List | 25 | 5 | 5.0 | 1 |
| Nutrition Info | 12 | 3 | 4.0 | 3 |
| Save Favorites | 8 | 2 | 4.0 | 3 |
| Share Plans | 5 | 2 | 2.5 | 5 |

Negotiate as a team: Do the WSJF results match your intuition? If not, discuss why and adjust as needed.

---

### Step 4: Compare and Align (10 minutes)
Review your **MoSCoW** and **WSJF** results side by side.  
Ask your team:
- Where do qualitative and quantitative rankings differ?  
- What trade-offs are worth making to satisfy stakeholders?  
- Which features align best with the project’s current goals?

Use negotiation and empathy to reach a shared agreement on your final **priority order**.

---

### Step 5: Quick Reflection (5 minutes)
As a team, reflect on:
- How did negotiation help resolve differences?  
- What factors did your team weigh most heavily (value, effort, risk, user impact)?  
- How do these prioritization tools support better collaboration?

---

## 5. Deliverables
Each team will submit:
1. **MoSCoW Prioritization Table** – listing each story by category  
2. **WSJF Calculation Table** – showing Cost of Delay, Job Size, and WSJF score  
3. **Final Ranked Backlog** – based on group consensus  
4. **Short Reflection (3–4 sentences)** – on how negotiation influenced the prioritization

---

## 6. Key Takeaways
- Prioritization aligns the team around shared value and focus.  
- MoSCoW supports quick qualitative sorting.  
- WSJF provides data-driven prioritization using value and effort.  
- Negotiation ensures prioritization reflects both business and technical perspectives.
