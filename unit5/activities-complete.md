## **Workshop 1: Backlog Grooming – Refining and Prioritizing User Stories**

**Topic:** Participate in backlog grooming to refine and prioritize user stories
**Power Skill Focus:** Collaborative negotiation and prioritization with stakeholders

### **Objective**

Students will learn how to engage in backlog grooming sessions by refining rough ideas into clear user stories and collaboratively negotiating which ones to prioritize for the first sprint.

### **Activity Overview**

**Scenario:** The MealMaster product owner (played by the instructor) has gathered a messy list of stakeholder requests:

* “It should suggest meals for the week.”
* “We need grocery list features.”
* “It should show nutrition info.”
* “Make it easy to share recipes with friends.”
* “Let it auto-sync with supermarket inventory.”

**Steps:**

1. **Team Formation:** Students work in small “Agile teams” of 4–6.
2. **Story Drafting:** Each team turns the stakeholder requests into refined **user stories** using the “As a [user], I want [goal] so that [benefit]” format.
3. **Grooming Discussion:** Teams conduct a **mock backlog grooming session**, negotiating which stories need clarification or splitting large ones into smaller pieces.
4. **Collaborative Prioritization:** Using MoSCoW categories (*Must have, Should have, Could have, Won’t have*), teams negotiate which features would be most valuable for a minimum viable product (MVP).
5. **Reflection:** Each team discusses how negotiation shaped their prioritization decisions and what trade-offs they made.

### **Deliverables**

* A refined set of 5–7 user stories
* A categorized MoSCoW prioritization chart
* Short reflection notes on how collaborative negotiation affected team decisions

## **Workshop 2: Sprint Planning – Uncovering Dependencies and Refining Acceptance Criteria**

**Topic:** Use sprint planning to uncover hidden dependencies and refine acceptance criteria
**Power Skill Focus:** Collaborative negotiation and prioritization with stakeholders

### **Objective**

Students will simulate a sprint planning meeting to identify dependencies between tasks and refine acceptance criteria that define “done.”

### **Activity Overview**

**Scenario:** Teams have selected their top “Must have” and “Should have” stories from Workshop 1. The next sprint will focus on these.

**Steps:**

1. **Review User Stories:** Teams revisit their top 3–4 stories from Workshop 1.
2. **Dependency Discovery:** For each story, students brainstorm what resources, systems, or people their team might depend on. (Example: “We can’t build the grocery list feature until the recipe database is ready.”)
3. **Refine Acceptance Criteria:** Using the **Given/When/Then** format, teams collaboratively define clear, testable acceptance criteria for each story.
4. **Negotiation Moment:** The “Product Owner” (played by the instructor or rotating student) questions feasibility and scope, prompting teams to negotiate adjustments—reducing scope, sequencing differently, or combining stories.
5. **Sprint Planning Outcome:** Each team builds a **Sprint Backlog**, including tasks, dependencies, and acceptance criteria.

### **Deliverables**

* A dependency map or list
* Refined acceptance criteria for each story
* A Sprint Backlog summary document

### **Debrief**

Discuss how early identification of dependencies prevented surprises and how collaborative negotiation ensured alignment between technical and stakeholder perspectives.

## **Workshop 3: Documenting Requirements – Using Agile-Friendly Forms**

**Topic:** Document requirements in agile-friendly forms (refined **user stories**, **epics**, and acceptance tests)
**Power Skill Focus:** Collaborative negotiation and prioritization with stakeholders

### **Objective**

Students will learn to document Agile requirements clearly and trace them from **epics** to **user stories** to **acceptance tests**, while ensuring stakeholder alignment through collaborative negotiation.

### **Activity Overview**

**Scenario:** The MealMaster product owner has introduced a new major feature idea: *“MealMaster should support weekly meal planning with automatic grocery list generation.”*
This becomes the **epic** that the team must decompose and document.

**Steps:**

1. **Epic Definition:** Each team defines the epic in one sentence.
2. **Breakdown into Stories:** Teams create 3–5 smaller user stories that roll up into the epic.
3. **Define Acceptance Tests:** For each story, students write 2–3 acceptance tests using the **Given/When/Then** format.
4. **Negotiation Exercise:** The product owner challenges the team’s assumptions (e.g., “Can we really automate all list items?”), prompting a collaborative discussion on scope and value.
5. **Documentation Review:** Teams finalize a concise Agile requirement set linking epics → stories → tests.

### **Deliverables**

* One documented epic with related user stories
* Acceptance test cases for each story
* Notes on negotiated adjustments

### **Debrief**

Highlight how clear documentation supports future collaboration and how negotiation ensures shared understanding of “done.”

## **Workshop 4: Applying Prioritization Techniques – MoSCoW and WSJF**

**Topic:** Apply prioritization techniques (MoSCoW, WSJF) in an Agile environment
**Power Skill Focus:** Collaborative negotiation and prioritization with stakeholders

### **Objective**

Students will apply quantitative and qualitative prioritization techniques to the MealMaster backlog, learning how to balance business value, technical effort, and stakeholder input.

### **Activity Overview**

**Scenario:** MealMaster now has a robust backlog with many user stories from previous workshops. The team must decide what to include in the next release.

**Steps:**

1. **Review Backlog:** Teams list all user stories created so far.
2. **Estimate Effort:** Using story points (1–8 scale), teams estimate relative effort for each story.
3. **Assign Business Value:** The product owner provides “value ratings” (or students propose them collaboratively).
4. **Apply WSJF:** Teams calculate WSJF scores (Cost of Delay ÷ Job Size) and rank features.
5. **Compare to MoSCoW:** Teams then revisit their earlier MoSCoW categories to see whether data-driven WSJF results align—or spark negotiation about differences.
6. **Negotiation Round:** The team and product owner discuss trade-offs between quick wins and long-term value, practicing respectful, transparent prioritization dialogue.

### **Deliverables**

* A WSJF calculation table
* A ranked backlog list
* A short negotiation summary documenting final priorities

### **Debrief**

Discuss how combining MoSCoW (qualitative) and WSJF (quantitative) provides a fuller picture. Reflect on how collaboration and emotional intelligence helped balance stakeholder interests and technical realities.
