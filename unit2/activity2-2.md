# Activity 2-2: Observing Workflows to Discover Tacit Requirements

## 🎯 Purpose
This activity helps students learn how to **conduct observations** and **capture tacit requirements** — the unspoken details of how work truly happens.  
Students will also apply **active listening** and **note-taking** skills to record steps, challenges, and assumptions accurately.

By the end of this activity, students should be able to:
- Observe a real-world or simulated workflow.  
- Identify explicit and implicit (tacit) requirements.  
- Document observations using clear, structured notes.  
- Summarize findings and insights in a short debrief.

## 🕒 Time Estimate
- **10 min:** Preparation and setup  
- **20–25 min:** Observation and note-taking  
- **10 min:** Debrief and discussion  

---

## 👥 Setup
Students work in **pairs**: one **observer** and one **participant**.  
- The **participant** performs a short, familiar task (chosen from the task list below).  
- The **observer** watches quietly, taking detailed notes on the workflow, tools, challenges, and unspoken habits.  
- Afterward, they discuss what was observed and reflect on hidden requirements or pain points.

Rotate roles so that each student has a chance to be both the observer and the participant.

## 🧠 Step 1: Prepare for Observation
Before observing, the **observer** should:
1. **Define a goal:** What do you hope to learn? (Steps, bottlenecks, tools, or workarounds?)  
2. **Plan your tools:** Bring a notebook, digital document, or template to record observations.  
3. **Remember:** You are *not* evaluating performance — you are learning how the process actually works.  
4. **Practice active listening and reflection:** When asking clarifying questions, paraphrase and confirm understanding to avoid assumptions.

---

## 👀 Step 2: Conduct the Observation
While the participant performs the task:
- Stay quiet and neutral. Blend in and let them work naturally.  
- Take **structured notes** that capture:  
  - **Steps:** What actions are performed and in what order?  
  - **Tools:** What systems, devices, or materials are used?  
  - **Challenges:** Where do delays or errors occur?  
  - **Workarounds:** What informal fixes or shortcuts are used?  
  - **Tacit insights:** What assumptions or habits are visible but unstated? (gestures, pauses, coordination cues, etc.)  

Use a simple format like this:

> **Task:** Booking a flight online  
> **Observation:** User opens three tabs to compare airlines.  
> **Challenge:** Confused by inconsistent baggage policies.  
> **Tacit insight:** User relies on color-coding flights by airline to track choices.

## 💬 Step 3: Ask Clarifying Questions
After the observation, take 5 minutes to ask follow-up questions like:
- “Can you tell me why you do that step first?”  
- “What happens if you skip that part?”  
- “How do you know you’ve finished successfully?”  
Remember to paraphrase and confirm answers to ensure accuracy.

---

## 🧩 Step 4: Debrief and Reflect
Each observer summarizes their findings in a short debrief that includes:
- A step-by-step workflow outline.  
- At least **three challenges or pain points**.  
- At least **two tacit requirements** or behaviors that weren’t mentioned but were observed.  
- Reflections on how **active listening** and **note-taking** helped uncover key insights.

Discuss as a class or in small groups what patterns emerged across different tasks.

---

## 🧰 Step 5: Deliverables
Each student should submit:
1. Observation notes (with clear structure and examples).  
2. Post-observation summary (1–2 paragraphs).  
3. Reflection on active listening and how it improved understanding.

## 📋 Observation Task Options (Choose One)

1. **Booking a Flight or Train Ticket Online**  
   - Observe how someone searches, compares, and books a ticket.  
   - Look for navigation patterns, price-checking habits, or trust signals.

2. **Ordering Food Through a Delivery App**  
   - Watch how they browse menus, select meals, and handle delivery preferences.  
   - Note any confusion with customization, delivery time, or payment steps.

3. **Submitting an Assignment in a Learning Management System (LMS)**  
   - Observe how a student uploads a file, checks confirmation, and reviews feedback.  
   - Identify unclear buttons, slow responses, or last-minute stress points.

4. **Checking Out Items at a Self-Service Kiosk**  
   - Watch how they scan, bag, and pay for items.  
   - Note physical challenges (scanning angles, payment flow) and emotional responses (frustration, satisfaction).

5. **Scheduling a Meeting Using a Calendar App**  
   - Observe how someone finds a time slot, adds participants, and sends invites.  
   - Look for assumptions about availability, time zones, or device syncing.

6. **Using a Fitness or Health Tracking App**  
   - See how users log workouts, set goals, or interpret progress charts.  
   - Capture how they react to feedback or handle missing data.

7. **Making a Bank Transfer Using a Mobile App**  
   - Observe how users navigate to transfer funds, verify accounts, and confirm transactions.  
   - Identify security concerns, verification confusion, or trust behaviors.

8. **Filling Out an Online Form or Application**  
   - Watch how users gather information, fill in fields, and review before submission.  
   - Look for skipped instructions, repeated entries, or browser navigation habits.

## 💡 Instructor Tips
- Encourage observers to use **neutral language** in notes — describe, don’t judge.  
- Remind them to focus on **what people do**, not what they *say* they do.  
- Promote the use of **paraphrasing and summarizing** to confirm understanding after observation.  
- Highlight that tacit requirements often come from *tiny moments* — gestures, hesitation, or reliance on informal tools.

### ✅ Outcome
By the end of this activity, students will understand how **observation reveals real user behavior**, and how **active listening and note-taking** work together to capture accurate, meaningful requirements.
