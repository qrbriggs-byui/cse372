# Mock Workshop Simulation: Event Ticketing App for the BYU–Idaho I-Center

## Overview
This activity gives students hands-on experience in facilitation, collaboration, and consensus-building during a requirements workshop.  
Students will simulate a real project discussion where they gather requirements for a new **event ticketing application** designed for the BYU–Idaho I-Center.  

This activity represents the **Workshop & Brainstorming** step in the larger unit sequence:
1. **Workshop & Brainstorming** → Generate diverse ideas  
2. **Affinity Mapping** → Organize and prioritize themes  
3. **BRD Drafting** → Formalize findings into professional documentation  
4. **Goal-Constraint Mapping** → Evaluate strategic fit and practical limitations  

---

## Learning Objectives
By the end of the simulation, students will be able to:
- Facilitate or participate in a structured requirements workshop.  
- Practice active listening, summarizing, and neutral facilitation techniques.  
- Identify and discuss user needs and priorities from multiple stakeholder perspectives.  
- Build early consensus around high-level project requirements.  

---

## Roles
Each group should ideally have **three students**, but groups of four or five can also work (duplicate roles if needed).

1. **App User:**  
   - Represents the general audience (students or community members) who will use the ticketing app.  
   - Focus on usability, convenience, and reliability.  
   - Think about how users purchase tickets, view events, and receive confirmations.

2. **Business Owner:**  
   - Represents BYU–Idaho’s event management or finance office.  
   - Concerned with cost, revenue, event logistics, and data accuracy.  
   - Think about policies, payment security, and record-keeping.

3. **App Developer:**  
   - Represents the technical team responsible for building and maintaining the system.  
   - Focus on feasibility, system integration, and data management.  
   - Think about scalability, performance, and technical constraints.

*(Optional fourth or fifth roles: Accessibility Advocate, Marketing Manager, etc.)*

## Materials Needed
- Sticky notes or a shared digital whiteboard (Miro, Mural, or Jamboard)  
- Timer (for keeping sessions focused)  
- “Workshop Agenda” handout or displayed slide with prompts  
- Reflection worksheet or journal space

## Activity Instructions

### Step 1: Setting the Stage (10 minutes)
- Form groups of three (or four).  
- Assign or let students choose roles: App User, Business Owner, App Developer.  
- Review the **purpose** of the workshop: to gather and align requirements for the event ticketing app.  
- Each group establishes 2–3 **ground rules** (e.g., one speaker at a time, all ideas valid, stay on topic).  
- Choose one student to act as the **first facilitator** (roles will rotate later).

### Step 2: The Workshop Discussion (20 minutes)
- The facilitator opens the discussion by clarifying the goal:  
  “We’re here to understand what the ticketing system needs to do for users, event organizers, and developers.”  
- Each participant shares their perspective and needs for the app.  
  - The facilitator practices **active listening** and **summarizing** statements (“So you’re saying…”).  
  - Ask clarifying questions (“Why is that important?” “Can you elaborate?”).  
- The facilitator records ideas on sticky notes or digital cards without judgment.  
- After 7–10 minutes, **rotate the facilitator role** so each student has a chance to lead part of the conversation.  

### Step 3: Summarizing and Building Consensus (10 minutes)
- As a group, review the captured ideas.  
- Identify 3–5 shared priorities that seem most important across all roles.  
- The final facilitator summarizes the agreed-upon needs aloud.  
- Example summary:  
  “It sounds like we all agree that the app must allow quick mobile ticket purchases, secure payment processing, and simple event check-in.”

## Discussion Prompts
Facilitators may use or adapt these to guide conversation:
- What does *success* look like for this ticketing system?  
- What pain points or frustrations should it solve?  
- What features are most critical for your role?  
- Are there constraints (budget, technology, staff) that might limit what we can do?  
- How might we measure success once the app launches?  

---

## Step 4: Debrief and Reflection (10–15 minutes)
After all groups finish:
- Each group shares **one key insight** and **one consensus point** from their discussion.  
- Instructors facilitate a short debrief:  
  - What made some facilitations more effective than others?  
  - How did asking “why” or “how” help clarify vague requirements?  
  - What tensions emerged between roles (e.g., user vs. business goals)?  
- Students complete a short reflection:  
  - What facilitation strategy worked best for you?  
  - How will you apply this in future teamwork?

---

## Deliverables
- A list of 5–7 raw requirements captured during the session (sticky notes or screenshot).  
- A brief summary paragraph written by the final facilitator describing:  
  - The group’s consensus on key requirements.  
  - Any unresolved points of disagreement.

## Assessment (Suggested Criteria)
| Criteria | Exemplary (Full Credit) | Developing | Needs Improvement |
|-----------|------------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Participation** | All members actively engaged, rotated facilitator roles smoothly | Uneven participation or missed rotation | Limited engagement or incomplete rotation |
| **Facilitation Skills** | Applied active listening, summarizing, neutrality | Attempted but inconsistent facilitation | Minimal facilitation effort |
| **Collaboration** | Group demonstrated consensus-building and respect | Some tension or dominance | Frequent conflict or disengagement |
| **Documentation** | Clear summary and accurate notes | Some missing details | Poorly organized or incomplete |

---

## Connection to Next Steps
This workshop provides the **raw material** for the next unit activities:
1. **Brainstorming & Affinity Mapping:** Students will organize and cluster their ideas from this session into themes (e.g., usability, payment, admin tools).  
2. **BRD Drafting:** Students will use their clustered themes to write high-level needs in a Business Requirements Document.  
3. **Goal-Constraint Mapping:** Students will connect their requirements to organizational priorities like budget, compliance, and scalability.

**Instructor Note:**  
Encourage empathy and curiosity throughout the session. Remind facilitators that their role is not to “win” the argument but to create space for understanding—just as described in the readings *Facilitating and Participating in a Requirements Workshop* and *Developing Facilitation and Consensus-Building Skills.*
