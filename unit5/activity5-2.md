# Workshop 2: Sprint Planning – Uncovering Dependencies and Refining Acceptance Criteria  
**Application Context:** MealMaster – A meal planning and grocery list app  
**Duration:** 45 minutes  
**Agile Practice Focus:** Sprint planning, identifying dependencies, refining acceptance criteria  
**Power Skill:** Collaborative negotiation and prioritization with stakeholders  

---

## 1. Purpose of This Workshop
In this session, you’ll experience how Agile teams use **Sprint Planning** to decide what work to take on, uncover hidden **dependencies**, and define **acceptance criteria** for user stories.  

You’ll use the **MealMaster** backlog you created in Workshop 1 to plan your first sprint. You’ll practice negotiation, collaboration, and communication—essential “power skills” for successful Agile teams.

---

## 2. Learning Objectives
By the end of this workshop, you should be able to:
- Explain the purpose of Sprint Planning in Scrum.  
- Identify dependencies that could affect sprint execution.  
- Write clear **acceptance criteria** using the Given/When/Then format.  
- Use negotiation and emotional intelligence to reach consensus on sprint scope.

---

## 3. Scenario Background: MealMaster
Your team is continuing development on **MealMaster**, an app that helps students plan meals and create grocery lists.  

From your backlog created in Workshop 1, choose **3–4 “Must have” or “Should have” user stories** to include in **Sprint 1**.  
You’ll identify dependencies between these stories, refine their acceptance criteria, and agree on which ones your team can realistically complete.

---

## 4. Workshop Steps (45-Minute Schedule)

### Step 1: Review & Select Sprint Stories (5 minutes)
- Review your **refined backlog** from Workshop 1.  
- Choose 3–4 user stories that fit into a two-week sprint.  
- Discuss briefly why these stories are the best choice to start with.

---

### Step 2: Identify Hidden Dependencies (10 minutes)
As a team, discuss:
- What needs to happen before this story can be started?  
- Are there technical, design, or data dependencies?  
- Does any story depend on another being completed first?

Example:  
> “We can’t generate a shopping list until we have the meal planning feature built.”  

Create a simple **dependency list or diagram** showing relationships between stories.  

Use negotiation to agree on which order makes sense for development.

---

### Step 3: Define Acceptance Criteria (15 minutes)
Acceptance criteria describe what it means for a user story to be **complete** and **successful**.  
Use the **Given/When/Then** format for each story:

Example:  
**Given** the student has selected meals for the week  
**When** they choose “Generate Shopping List”  
**Then** the app displays a complete grocery list for the selected meals  

Each team member should help craft or refine **2–3 acceptance criteria per story.**

Discuss and negotiate what’s realistic to include in this sprint.  
Be collaborative—listen, question, and refine together.

---

### Step 4: Confirm Sprint Scope (10 minutes)
Now that you’ve identified dependencies and defined success:
- Reassess: Can all chosen stories fit into one sprint?  
- Remove or split any that are too large or blocked by dependencies.  
- Agree as a team on your final **Sprint Backlog**—the stories you commit to completing.

Use negotiation and empathy to balance stakeholder expectations with technical feasibility.

---

### Step 5: Quick Reflection (5 minutes)
Before time runs out, take 2–3 minutes to jot down thoughts:
- What dependencies were most surprising?  
- How did your team use negotiation to resolve disagreements?  
- How did defining acceptance criteria help you clarify the work?  

---

## 5. Deliverables
Each team will submit:
1. **Sprint Backlog Summary** – List of 3–4 selected stories  
2. **Dependency List or Map**  
3. **Refined Acceptance Criteria** – 2–3 per story  
4. **Short Reflection (3–4 sentences)** on negotiation and teamwork

---

## 6. Key Takeaways
- Sprint Planning ensures the team commits to realistic, valuable work.  
- Identifying dependencies early prevents sprint blockers.  
- Acceptance criteria define what “done” really means.  
- Effective negotiation builds understanding and trust within the team.
