# Workshop: Transforming Findings into User Stories with Acceptance Criteria

**Duration:** 45 minutes  
**Goal:** Learn how to transform user feedback and prototype insights into clear, testable user stories with acceptance criteria.

---

## Overview

In this workshop, you’ll use the insights gathered from your **user surveys** and **low-fidelity prototypes** to define user stories that capture real user needs. You’ll then write acceptance criteria to clarify what “done” means for each story. This process turns your research into actionable development requirements.

---

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:
1. Identify user needs and frustrations from research findings.  
2. Write user stories that describe features from the user’s perspective.  
3. Define acceptance criteria that make stories testable and measurable.  
4. Communicate requirements clearly using both **textual** (stories and criteria) and **visual** (prototype references) strategies.

## Workshop Agenda

### 1. Introduction (5 minutes)
- Review how user surveys and prototypes help uncover needs and behaviors.  
- Discuss how user stories connect empathy and engineering action:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.  
- Introduce the standard **user story format**:  
  > *As a [type of user], I want [some goal], so that [some reason].*

---

### 2. Identify Key Insights (10 minutes)
- Review your findings from the previous workshops.  
- Highlight two categories of feedback from users:  
  - **Needs and frustrations** — problems users expressed.  
  - **Behavioral patterns** — how users expect the app to behave.  
- Choose 2–3 meaningful insights to turn into user stories.  

**Example:**  
- Feedback: “It’s hard to tell which classes are already full.”  
- Insight: Users want to see real-time seat availability when planning their schedules.

---

### 3. Write User Stories (15 minutes)
- For each insight, write a user story using the standard format.  
- Make sure your stories include:  
  - **Who** the user is.  
  - **What** the user wants to do.  
  - **Why** it matters.  
- Example:  
  > As a student, I want to see which classes are full so that I can plan alternatives early.  

**Tip:** Keep your language clear and concise. Each story should be one sentence focused on value.

---

### 4. Add Acceptance Criteria (10 minutes)
- For each user story, write 3–5 acceptance criteria that describe what must be true for the story to be complete.  
- Criteria can be written as **checklists** or **Given–When–Then** statements:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.  
- Example (Checklist):  
  - The system displays seat availability next to each class.  
  - A full class is marked as “Closed.”  
  - The information refreshes every minute.  

**Alternative (Given–When–Then):**  

 Given the student is viewing the course list,
When a class reaches full capacity,
Then it is marked as “Closed” and cannot be added to the schedule.


---

### 5. Reflect and Present (5 minutes)
- Each team shares one user story and its acceptance criteria.  
- Discuss as a class:  
  - What makes a user story clear and useful?  
  - How do acceptance criteria reduce ambiguity?

---

## Deliverables

By the end of the session, each team should have:  
- 2–3 user stories based on research findings.  
- 3–5 acceptance criteria per story.  
- A short written summary (100–150 words) explaining how their stories were informed by survey and prototype feedback.  
- Annotated visuals linking each story to relevant prototype screens.

---

## Tools
- Google Docs or Miro for story mapping  
- Paper or digital whiteboards for sketching  
- Access to previous survey results and prototype files  

---

## Communication Focus

Show how **textual precision** (well-written user stories) and **visual clarity** (prototype references) combine to communicate requirements effectively. This mirrors how professional teams align product design and development:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.
