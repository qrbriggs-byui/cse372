**Duration:** 45 minutes  
**Goal:** Learn how to design and deploy a user survey to collect meaningful, statistically relevant feedback for a course planning application.

## Overview

In this workshop, you will work in small groups to create a short user survey that helps you understand how students plan their academic schedules. You will define objectives, craft effective questions, and prepare to analyze the results.

---

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:
1. Define clear objectives for a user survey.  
2. Write effective open-ended and closed-ended survey questions.  
3. Tailor a survey to a target audience.  
4. Demonstrate effective communication using both visual (survey layout, charts) and textual (summaries, question phrasing) strategies.

## Workshop Agenda

### 1. Introduction (5 minutes)
- Review the purpose of user surveys in software requirements gathering.  
- Discuss how surveys provide both **quantitative** and **qualitative** insights.  

### 2. Define Survey Objectives (10 minutes)
- In your group, brainstorm 2–3 goals for your survey.  
  Examples:  
  - Understand how students choose courses each semester.  
  - Identify common frustrations with existing course selection tools.  
- Write your objectives clearly at the top of your survey document.

### 3. Design Survey Questions (20 minutes)
- Create 5–8 survey questions that align with your objectives.  
  Include a mix of:  
  - **Closed-ended questions** (e.g., multiple choice, rating scales).  
  - **Open-ended questions** (e.g., “Describe how you decide which electives to take.”).  
- Keep questions short, specific, and unbiased.  
- Use **visual communication** by formatting your survey layout clearly—group related questions, use spacing and headings.  

### 4. Peer Review and Feedback (5 minutes)
- Exchange surveys with another group.  
- Provide feedback on clarity, tone, and structure.  
- Suggest improvements for question variety or target alignment.

### 5. Wrap-Up and Reflection (5 minutes)
- As a group, discuss what you learned about creating surveys that gather meaningful, actionable feedback.  
- Record one key insight you’ll apply when you analyze results later.

## Tools
- Google Forms or Typeform for survey creation  
- Google Docs or a whiteboard for brainstorming  
- Optional: Figma or Canva for visual layout planning

## Communication Focus

Demonstrate your ability to combine **visual clarity** (survey design and structure) with **textual precision** (clear, unbiased wording).
