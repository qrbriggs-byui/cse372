# Step 2 Activity: Brainstorming and Affinity Mapping

## Overview
In this one-hour class, you’ll build on the ideas your group generated during the **Mock Workshop Simulation**.  
You will practice creative collaboration using **brainstorming** and **affinity mapping**—two key techniques for organizing large sets of ideas into meaningful requirement themes.

By the end of this session, you’ll have a set of clearly labeled requirement clusters that you will **submit as a deliverable** and use to write your **Business Requirements Document (BRD)** in the next step.

## Learning Goals
By completing this activity, you will:
- Apply brainstorming and affinity mapping techniques to group and interpret user and stakeholder ideas.  
- Collaborate effectively to identify major requirement themes.  
- Practice consensus-building by labeling and explaining clusters.  
- Create a professional visual artifact that captures your group’s analysis.

---

## Materials Needed
- Sticky notes or a virtual board (Miro, Jamboard, Mural, Google Slides, etc.)  
- Your notes or documentation from the **Mock Workshop Simulation**  
- Timer or phone (to manage discussion time)

## Activity Timeline (60 minutes total)

### **1. Brainstorming Session – 15 minutes**
After your workshop, capture every idea that emerged—no filtering or judging ideas.

**Instructions:**
1. Rejoin your same small group from the workshop (3–5 members).  
2. On sticky notes or a virtual board, write down **each idea or requirement** from your workshop discussion (one idea per note).  
3. Add any new ideas that come to mind now.  
4. The goal is *quantity over quality*—focus on getting every thought on the board.

**Facilitation Tip:** Rotate the facilitator from last time so another member practices leading. Their job is to keep ideas flowing and prevent critique.

### **2. Affinity Mapping Exercise – 30 minutes**
Now you’ll organize your brainstormed ideas into meaningful clusters.

**Instructions:**
1. Work as a team to look for related or similar ideas.  
   - Example clusters: **Usability**, **Automation**, **Data Management**, **Security**, **Event Promotion**.  
2. Move sticky notes into groups based on natural relationships.  
3. Discuss what connects the ideas in each group.  
4. Give each cluster a **clear theme label** that captures its purpose.  
5. Take a screenshot or photo of your final clusters (this is your deliverable).  
6. Upload your image to Canvas with a short explanation of your categories (3–5 sentences).

**Facilitation Tip:**  
- Practice **active listening** and **neutral facilitation** as described in your reading on *Developing Facilitation and Consensus-Building Skills.*  
- Summarize what teammates say before labeling clusters to ensure shared understanding.

---

### **3. Reflection and Submission – 15 minutes**
- As a group, briefly review your affinity map and confirm that the themes make sense.  
- Each group writes a short (3–5 sentence) explanation to accompany their screenshot:  
  - Why you grouped ideas as you did.  
  - What insights or patterns emerged.  
  - Any disagreements or challenges encountered.  
- **Submit both your screenshot and written explanation to Canvas before the end of class.**

---

## Discussion Prompts (Optional)
If time allows, consider:
- Which requirement themes appeared across multiple groups?  
- How did facilitation techniques help you organize ideas efficiently?  
- What did you learn about collaboration and consensus during this step?  

---

## Deliverables
- A digital or photo copy of your **Affinity Map**.  
- A short **written explanation (3–5 sentences)** describing your cluster labels and reasoning.  

---

## Connection to Next Step
Your clustered themes will serve as the **foundation for your Business Requirements Document (BRD)**.  
In the next class, you’ll translate these themes into **high-level needs** and organize them according to the **BRD structure** (objectives, scope, requirements, and success criteria).

---

### Tip for Success
- Be open-minded—unexpected connections often reveal deeper insights.  
- Stay inclusive—make sure every teammate’s ideas are visible and considered.  
- Focus on **understanding, not perfection**—your clusters will evolve as you move toward documentation.
