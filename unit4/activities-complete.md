# Learning Activities: Communicating Requirements for a Course Planning Application

This sequence of activities helps students build skills in designing surveys, creating prototypes, and writing user stories with acceptance criteria. Each stage emphasizes both **visual** and **textual communication** of requirements.

## 1. Design and Deploy User Surveys to Gather Large-Scale Feedback *(Pre-work Activity 1)*

**Objective:**  
Help students collect meaningful, statistically relevant data about course planning needs.

**Activities:**  
- **Brainstorm and Draft:** In small teams, students identify 3–4 key research goals (e.g., “What challenges do students face when selecting electives?”).  
- **Survey Design Workshop:** Using Google Forms or Typeform, each team designs a survey that includes a mix of *closed-ended* (quantitative) and *open-ended* (qualitative) questions.  
- **Peer Review:** Teams swap surveys and provide feedback on clarity, bias, and usability.  
- **Deploy and Analyze:** Students send their finalized survey to classmates or other departments to collect at least 30 responses, then visualize the data (charts, summaries) and identify patterns.  

**Communication Focus:**  
Students prepare a short **visual report** (charts, graphs) with a **textual summary** explaining key takeaways.

## 2. Build Low-Fidelity Prototypes to Elicit Clarifications *(Pre-work Activity 2)*

**Objective:**  
Translate survey insights into early design ideas for the course planning tool.

**Activities:**  
- **Sketching Session:** Students sketch key screens—course catalog, degree progress, schedule planner—on paper or whiteboards.  
- **Create Clickable Mockups:** Using Figma or Balsamiq, teams make simple, navigable prototypes that reflect core survey findings.  
- **Feedback Session:** Invite peers or potential users to interact with prototypes and “think aloud” as they navigate.  
- **Refinement:** Teams document feedback and adjust their prototypes accordingly.  

**Communication Focus:**  
Students present their prototypes visually and accompany them with **brief written explanations** (use cases, design intent).

## 3. Transform Findings into User Stories with Acceptance Criteria *(Applied Activity 1)*

**Objective:**  
Turn user research and prototype feedback into actionable development requirements.

**Activities:**  
- **Story Mapping Workshop:** Teams identify distinct user goals (e.g., “register for preferred courses,” “track degree completion”).  
- **Write User Stories:** Each team writes 4–6 user stories using the template “As a [user], I want [goal], so that [reason].”  
- **Define Acceptance Criteria:** For each story, students create 3–5 acceptance criteria specifying what success looks like.  
- **Peer Review:** Teams exchange stories for critique, focusing on clarity, completeness, and testability.  

**Communication Focus:**  
Students write their stories using **clear, user-centered language** and present them with **annotated visuals** (e.g., linking each story to prototype screens).

---

## 4. Explore Formats for Acceptance Criteria (Checklist, Given–When–Then) *(Applied Activity 2)*

**Objective:**  
Deepen understanding of different formats for expressing acceptance criteria.

**Activities:**  
- **Format Comparison Exercise:** Students take one user story from Activity 3 and express its acceptance criteria in both **checklist** and **Given–When–Then** formats.  
- **Testing Simulation:** Pairs of students act as *developer* and *tester*—the developer implements the feature conceptually, while the tester validates it using the criteria.  
- **Reflection and Discussion:** Groups discuss which format better captured system behavior and why.  
- **Final Deliverable:** Teams compile all user stories and acceptance criteria into a **requirements specification document** that blends visuals (mockups, diagrams) and text.  

**Communication Focus:**  
Students submit a **polished document** and give a **brief presentation**, using both visual and textual communication to explain how their design meets user needs.

## Outcome Integration

These activities build progressively:
- **Surveys and prototypes** form the research and discovery foundation.  
- **User stories and acceptance criteria** turn insights into structured requirements.  
- **Visual (mockups, diagrams)** and **textual (stories, summaries)** communication are emphasized at every stage to mirror professional software engineering practice.
