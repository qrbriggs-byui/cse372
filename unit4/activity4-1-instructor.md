# Instructor Guide: Workshop on Designing and Deploying User Surveys

**Duration:** 45 minutes  
**Audience:** Undergraduate software engineering or requirements gathering students  
**Workshop Theme:** Creating surveys to support requirements gathering for a course planning application.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, students should be able to:
1. Explain the purpose of user surveys in requirements engineering.  
2. Design clear and unbiased survey questions aligned with research goals.  
3. Demonstrate effective use of visual and textual communication strategies.  
4. Reflect on how survey design influences the quality of user feedback.

## Materials Needed
- Whiteboard or digital brainstorming space  
- Projector for examples of good vs. poor survey questions  
- Laptops with access to Google Forms or Typeform  
- Peer review checklist handout (optional)

## Session Breakdown (45 minutes)

### **1. Introduction (5 minutes)**
- Briefly discuss why surveys are essential in requirements gathering.  
- Explain the difference between **qualitative** (open-ended) and **quantitative** (closed-ended) data.  
- Emphasize the goal: to collect **meaningful** and **statistically relevant** feedback.

**Instructor Tip:** Use examples like “Rate how easy it is to choose your courses each semester” (quantitative) vs. “What frustrates you about choosing courses?” (qualitative).

---

### **2. Define Survey Objectives (10 minutes)**
- Have groups identify 2–3 specific learning or usability goals for the course planning app.  
- Encourage them to phrase objectives clearly and realistically (e.g., measurable and focused on user needs).

**Instructor Support:** Circulate the room, asking probing questions like:  
- “Who are your target users?”  
- “How will this question help you design better features?”  

---

### **3. Design Survey Questions (20 minutes)**
- Instruct groups to create a balanced mix of question types.  
- Encourage clarity and brevity—each question should focus on one idea.  
- Remind students to use plain, inclusive language that all students can understand.

**Instructor Demo (optional):** Project a short example survey and dissect how each question serves its objective.  

**Coaching Focus:**  
- Avoid double-barreled questions (e.g., “Do you find the interface clear and easy to navigate?”).  
- Use Likert scales or rating options to capture measurable data.  

---

### **4. Peer Review and Feedback (5 minutes)**
- Have groups swap surveys and provide feedback using a checklist:  
  - Are objectives clear?  
  - Are questions aligned with objectives?  
  - Is the layout readable and user-friendly?  

**Instructor Tip:** Highlight examples of well-written questions during feedback discussion.

---

### **5. Wrap-Up and Reflection (5 minutes)**
- Facilitate a short class discussion:  
  - “What made some surveys more effective than others?”  
  - “How does visual layout affect user engagement?”  
- Encourage students to save feedback for use in future prototype design.

---

## Assessment and Follow-Up

**During Class:** Observe group collaboration and question quality.  
**After Class:** Review final surveys and summaries for:  
- Alignment between objectives and questions  
- Diversity of question types  
- Clarity and professional tone  

**Extension Activity:**  
In the next session, students can distribute their surveys and later analyze results to identify feature priorities for their prototype.

## Instructor Notes on Communication Skills

Throughout the workshop, emphasize how effective requirements communication combines **visual organization** (clear layout, structure) and **textual accuracy** (precise question phrasing). Encourage students to use design and writing together as tools for clarity and empathy in software development.
