# Mock Workshop Simulation: Event Ticketing App for the BYU–Idaho I-Center

## Overview
In this activity, you’ll participate in a **mock requirements workshop** to practice facilitation, collaboration, and consensus-building.  
You’ll simulate a real project discussion where your group gathers requirements for a new **event ticketing app** for the BYU–Idaho I-Center.

This activity represents the first step in the unit sequence:

1. **Workshop & Brainstorming** → Generate diverse ideas  
2. **Affinity Mapping** → Organize and prioritize themes  
3. **BRD Drafting** → Formalize findings into professional documentation  
4. **Goal-Constraint Mapping** → Evaluate strategic fit and practical limitations  

---

## Learning Goals
By the end of this activity, you will be able to:
- Facilitate or participate in a structured requirements workshop.  
- Practice active listening, summarizing, and neutral facilitation techniques.  
- Identify and discuss user needs from multiple stakeholder perspectives.  
- Build early consensus around high-level requirements.  

---

## Your Roles
Each group should have three members (or more if needed). Each student will take one of the following roles:

### **1. App User**
- Represents people who will use the ticketing app.  
- Focus on **usability, convenience, and reliability**.  
- Think about how users find events, buy tickets, and get confirmations.  

### **2. Business Owner**
- Represents BYU–Idaho’s event or finance office.  
- Focus on **cost, revenue, and operations**.  
- Think about payment systems, data accuracy, and event management.  

### **3. App Developer**
- Represents the technical team building the system.  
- Focus on **feasibility, integration, and performance**.  
- Think about databases, scalability, and technical constraints.  

*(If your group has more members, add roles like Accessibility Advocate or Marketing Manager.)*

## Materials Needed
- Sticky notes or a digital whiteboard (Miro, Jamboard, Google Slides, etc.)  
- A timer (keep discussions focused)  
- A shared document or notepad to record group ideas

## Activity Steps

### **Step 1: Setting the Stage (10 minutes)**
- Form your group and assign roles.  
- Review the purpose: **to identify needs and priorities** for the I-Center ticketing app.  
- Establish 2–3 ground rules (examples: one speaker at a time, respect all ideas, stay focused).  
- Choose one person to start as **facilitator**.  

### **Step 2: The Workshop Discussion (20 minutes)**
- The facilitator opens the session:  
  > “We’re here to understand what the ticketing app needs to do for users, event organizers, and developers.”  
- Each role shares their perspective. The facilitator:  
  - Listens actively and summarizes key points (“So you’re saying…”).  
  - Asks clarifying questions (“Why is that important?”).  
  - Records all ideas on sticky notes or a shared board.  
- After 7–10 minutes, **rotate roles** so another person becomes the facilitator.  
- Continue until all members have led part of the discussion.  

### **Step 3: Summarizing and Building Consensus (10 minutes)**
- Review all ideas together.  
- Identify **3–5 shared priorities** that seem most important.  
- The final facilitator summarizes what the group agreed on.  
  Example:  
  > “It sounds like we all agree that the app must support quick mobile ticket purchases, secure payments, and an easy check-in process.”

## Discussion Prompts
Facilitators can use these questions to guide the group:
- What does *success* look like for this ticketing system?  
- What pain points or frustrations should it solve?  
- What features are most critical for your role?  
- Are there constraints (budget, time, technology) that could affect this project?  
- How might we measure whether the app is successful?  

---

## **Step 4: Reflection and Debrief (10 minutes)**
After your discussion:
- Each group shares **one key insight** and **one consensus point** with the class.  
- Write a short reflection (about one paragraph):  
  - What did you learn about facilitation and collaboration?  
  - What communication techniques worked best?  
  - What challenges came up when trying to reach consensus?  

---

## Deliverables
- A short list (5–7) of key requirements your group identified.  
- A brief written summary (by the final facilitator) describing:  
  - The group’s consensus points.  
  - Any disagreements that couldn’t be resolved.  

---

## Tips for Success
- **Be curious, not competitive.** Your goal is understanding, not winning an argument.  
- **Listen actively** and make sure every voice is heard.  
- **Rotate facilitators** so everyone practices leading the group.  
- **Focus on “what” and “why,”** not on technical details of “how” to build the app.

## Connection to the Next Step
The notes you create today will become the raw material for your next activity:
- You’ll **brainstorm and cluster** these ideas into themes.  
- Then you’ll **write a BRD (Business Requirements Document)** that captures your findings.  
- Finally, you’ll **analyze organizational goals and constraints** to refine your recommendations.
