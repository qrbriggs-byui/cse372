# Workshop: Building Low-Fidelity Prototypes to Elicit Clarifications

**Duration:** 45 minutes  
**Goal:** Learn how to create and test low-fidelity prototypes to clarify requirements and communicate ideas visually.

---

## Overview

In this workshop, you’ll design a low-fidelity prototype for a **course planning application** that helps students choose and schedule classes. You’ll start with user goals, sketch out screens, connect them through simple navigation, and test your designs with peers to gather feedback.

---

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:
1. Create basic wireframes and clickable mockups to represent key system features.  
2. Use low-fidelity prototypes to clarify user needs and requirements.  
3. Gather and apply feedback to improve design clarity.  
4. Communicate requirements effectively using both **visual** and **textual** methods.

## Workshop Agenda

### 1. Introduction (5 minutes)
- Review what low-fidelity prototypes are and why they’re valuable.  
- Discuss how visuals—like wireframes—help communicate structure and flow to diverse stakeholders:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.  
- Review examples of wireframes and clickable mockups.  

### 2. Define User Goals (10 minutes)
- As a group, identify 2–3 core tasks for the course planning app. Examples:  
  - “Select courses for next semester.”  
  - “View completed degree requirements.”  
  - “Check for schedule conflicts.”  
- Write each goal as a short **user story** (e.g., “As a student, I want to check available courses so that I can plan my schedule effectively.”).

### 3. Sketch Wireframes (15 minutes)
- Use paper, whiteboards, or a digital tool like **Figma** or **Balsamiq**.  
- Draw boxes and labels for key elements—menus, buttons, lists, forms.  
- Create at least three screens, such as:  
  - **Home page** (overview of courses)  
  - **Course selection page**  
  - **Schedule view or confirmation screen**  
- Use visual communication principles from the readings: keep layouts clear, label actions clearly, and use consistent flow:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.

### 4. Add Simple Navigation and Test (10 minutes)
- Link your screens (physically with arrows or digitally with clickable hotspots).  
- Pair with another group and conduct a short usability walkthrough.  
- Ask questions like:  
  - “Where would you click to register?”  
  - “Was anything confusing about the layout?”  
- Take notes on their reactions—watch for hesitation or confusion.

### 5. Reflect and Refine (5 minutes)
- Discuss what feedback you received.  
- Write a brief summary describing one improvement you’d make based on user feedback.

## Deliverables

By the end of the session, each team should have:
- A set of at least **three connected wireframes** or mockup screens.  
- A brief (100–150 word) written reflection describing user feedback and design revisions.  

---

## Tools
- Paper and markers or whiteboard  
- Figma, Balsamiq, or Adobe XD (optional)  
- Sticky notes or digital comments for peer feedback

## Communication Focus

Demonstrate your ability to explain your prototype both **visually** (through clear sketches and layouts) and **textually** (through user stories, annotations, and reflection notes). Your goal is to make your design understandable to both technical and non-technical audiences.
